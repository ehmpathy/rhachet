rhachet's goal is to make role based agent construction simple

milestones

1. make(<distill>[route]): <enstitch> & <enweave>
   1. enable declaration of any thought route
   2. enable observable execution of any thought route

2. make(<distill>[context]): [[role]] && [[tactic]]
   2. compose [role]s from [[skill]]s and [[trait]]s
   1. compose [tactic]s from [route]s that intersect [[skill]]s and [[trait]]s
   2. distill enprompt's from [role]s and [tactic]s

3. tune(<distill>[context]): <expand>[context] && <compress>[context]
   1. collect case:test
   2. entool context expansion (e.g., ensure all relevant shapes are loaded in context)
      1. e.g., "which code files are relevant examples"?
   3. entool context compression (e.g., summarize information to the zoom that is relevant for the task, to eliminate distractions)
      1. e.g., "how relevant is this information?"
