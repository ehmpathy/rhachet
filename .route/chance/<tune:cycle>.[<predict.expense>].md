given
- exists (usecase: predict expense of routes (time, money))
  - predict time it will take to complete
  - predict money it will take to complete

then
- chance (<grade:auto>: measure success of prediction, given predicted vs realized)
- chance ([cycle]: tune prediction; <encase>([route,grade]) -> [case:test] -> <entune> -> [<predict>]++ )
- chance (<encycle> tune prediction -> <tune:auto>)

and we should take it
