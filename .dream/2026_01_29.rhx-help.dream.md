dream = 

wish we had an `rhx help` skill

probably, via rhachet-roles-rhachet, which is installed by consumers via a peer-dep in rhachet

which would

1. be a solid skill which just enumerates the things they could do and gives them an expplainer

highlights


rhx find === search for relevant skills, via grep (solid skill)

and

rhx help --ask === spins up an actor to talk with, with full context of rhachet && your installed roles (available briefs and skills) && with full context of the broader rhachet directory of roles, briefs, and skills that you can access


rhx find --ask === spins up an actor with the same concept, except this time, primed to help you find either a role or a skill 


---

that way, it should be super simple to use rhachet interactively (via --ask) and statically (without ask)
