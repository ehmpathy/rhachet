as part of this, we want to better define and distinguish between
  "suppliers" and "adapters"

  first, "suppliers" like Role suppliers  and Brain suppliers;

  lets add a brief right now to .agent/repo=.this/role=any/briefs which
  explains the supplier concept

  the rhachet framework dispatches caller invocations across the supplied
  resources that are configured (implicitly via dependencies, or explicitly
  via config)

  suppliers supply resources which fulfill domain specific behavior and
  leverage rhachet for isomorphic and uniform dispatch (similar to what
  terraform calls "providers"). they supply resources that adhere to the
  rhachet contract.

  for example
  - Role suppliers, supply roles for use with rhachet. they supply sets of
  roles via RoleRegistries (a.k.a. RoleRepos). they also supply
  RoleHooksOnDispatch, which add middleware to role actions (e.g., transform
  skill inputs, observe skill outputs, etc)

  - Brain suppliers, supply brains for use with rhachet. they supply sets
  of BrainRepls and BrainAtoms via BrainRegistries (a.k.a. BrainRepos).
  they also supply BrainHooksAdapters, which adapt hook requests declared in
  the rhachet contract into the contract of whatever brain is in use. this
  enables roles to specify RoleHooksOnBrain which add middleware over brain
  actions (e.g., onTool, onBoot, onStop) (e.g., to enroll a BrainRepl as a
  role)



  next, lets add a separate brief that explains the adapter concept

  an adapter is any mechanism which transforms a payload from one ShapeA to
  ShapeB, to adapt from ContractA to ContractB

  for example, the BrainHooksAdapters enable rhachet Roles to declare
  .hooks via a rhachet contract, which we then know will be translated via
  a BrainHooksAdapter to apply to whatever brain is requested (e.g., add
  SessionStart, PreToolUse, and onStop) hooks to claude-code

  note that we dont have a DispatchHooksAdapter, because today, the only
  dispatch interface rhachet supports is the rhachet cli itself.
  in the future, we may need an DispatchHooksAdapter, when we support
  remote dispatch, for example.
