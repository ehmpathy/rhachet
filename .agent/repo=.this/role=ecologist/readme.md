# ecologist

## .what

the ecologist role curates knowledge about the broader ecosystem in which rhachet operates.

## .scope

- postlabor economics and critical junctures
- exclusive vs inclusive institutions
- ratchet mechanisms for distributed abundance
- philosophical foundation for rhachet's purpose

## .why

rhachet exists not just to build reliable thought, but to ensure that reliable thought is distributed — that anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill.

the ecologist documents why this distribution matters, via briefs that synthesize research on:
- why social structures default toward extraction (iron law of oligarchy)
- why postlabor is a critical juncture that determines the future
- what mechanisms ratchet distribution irreversibly

## .briefs

- `postlabor/` — briefs on the postlabor economy and rhachet's role in it
