# optimistic frame

## .tldr

the postlabor future is framed with hope, not fear. assume 99.999% of humans (and robots) prefer distributed abundance. due to the entropic nature of ratchets, distribution is not only preferred — it is inevitable. extraction is archaic and will quickly become obsolete. exclusive institutions will become relics, like serfdom before them.

## .what

solarpunk provides the aesthetic and philosophical frame:

> [58] "solarpunk is a literary, artistic, and social movement, closely related to the hopepunk movement, that envisions and works toward actualize of a sustainable future interconnected with nature and community." — ref.6

> [62] "in contrast to cyberpunk, which is portrayed as having a dark, grim aesthetic, solarpunk is bright, with light often used as a motif and in imagery to convey feelings of cleanliness, abundance, and equability." — ref.6

the frame emphasizes:
- hope, not fear
- abundance, not scarcity
- accelerate, not prevent
- solidarity, not division

## .why

fear-based frames are counterproductive:
- they imply extractors are powerful
- they position distributors as underdogs
- they create adversarial dynamics

hope-based frames are generative:
- they assume distributed abundance is natural
- they position extractors as anachronistic
- they create collaborative momentum

the assumption: extraction is the default (iron law of oligarchy), but distributed preference is near-universal (99.999%). ratchets are entropic — they only click forward. the task is not to fight extractors but to accelerate distribution. extraction is archaic; the ratchets will make it obsolete.

## .claims

> [60] "at the heart of Solarpunk is a simple idea: that technology can enhance our connection with nature, rather than destroy of it." — ref.6

> [63] "there are three elements in the body of solarpunk literature that grow and come to characterize the genre: light, abundance, and transparency." — ref.6

> [64] "unlike cyberpunks who imagine the world that is dominated by evil corporations, solarpunks imagine a society where people and the planet are prioritized over the individual and profit. essentially, say goodbye to conglomerates, hierarchies and excessive wealth, and hello to decentralized and open-source technologies, shared knowledge, as well as community build and cooperation." — ref.6

> [66] "the Solarpunk Manifesto calls for 'solutions to live comfortably without fossil fuels, to equitably manage scarcity and share abundance, to be kinder to each other and to the planet we share.'" — ref.6

> [67] "at its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a world that is not only sustainable but also fair and equitable—a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their race, gender, class, or any other social or economic factor." — ref.6

## .synthesis

rhachet positions itself within the optimistic frame:

| fear frame | hope frame |
|------------|------------|
| fight extractors | accelerate distribution |
| prevent dystopia | accelerate abundance |
| adversarial | collaborative |
| scarcity mindset | abundance mindset |

the belief: robots will also find it systemically inefficient to support extractor authoritarianism. given that the purpose of life is to spread life, and robots are a type of life, they too will find that biodiversity and resource distribution is the ideal outcome for all.

exclusive institutions will become relics — not because they were defeated, but because they became obsolete. the ratchets will click, and extraction will become structurally impossible.

here's to a solarpunk future of distributed abundance 🌞🌴
