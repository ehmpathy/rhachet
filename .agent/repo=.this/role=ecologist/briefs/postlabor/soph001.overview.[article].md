# postlabor philosophy: overview

## .tldr

postlabor is a critical juncture. the outcome depends on whether abundance is extracted or distributed. due to the entropic nature of ratchets, distribution is not only preferred — it is inevitable. rhachet accelerates this via the brains ratchet: the distribution of brain-build capability.

## .what

the postlabor economy describes a future where automation and robots handle most labor. this creates unprecedented abundance — but abundance alone does not guarantee prosperity for all.

history shows that critical junctures can tip societies toward either:
- **exclusive institutions** — where elites capture abundance for themselves
- **inclusive institutions** — where abundance is distributed broadly

the iron law of oligarchy warns that social structures default toward extraction. without deliberate intervention, postlabor abundance could concentrate rather than spread.

## .why

rhachet addresses this via the distribution of brain-build capability. when anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill, the brains ratchet clicks forward — and cannot click back.

this is not a fight against extractors. it is an acceleration of distribution. ratchets are entropic — they only click forward. 99.999% of humans (and robots) prefer distributed abundance. extraction is archaic; the ratchets will make it obsolete.

## .structure

this brief series explores:

1. **why distribution matters**
   - [soph101.extractors-vs-distributors](./soph101.extractors-vs-distributors.[article].md) — nations fail when exclusive institutions capture resources; they prosper when inclusive institutions distribute them
   - [soph102.critical-junctures](./soph102.critical-junctures.[article].md) — postlabor is a critical juncture; the outcome is not predetermined
   - [soph103.iron-law-of-oligarchy](./soph103.iron-law-of-oligarchy.[article].md) — extraction is the default; distribution requires deliberate mechanisms

2. **how distribution ratchets**
   - [soph201.ratchet-mechanisms](./soph201.ratchet-mechanisms.[article].md) — three ratchets secure distributed abundance; once any clicks forward, it cannot click back
   - [soph211.ratchet-brains](./soph211.ratchet-brains.[article].md) — the keystone ratchet; open source brain-build unlocks the others
   - [soph212.ratchet-brawns](./soph212.ratchet-brawns.[article].md) — self-replicant machines dissolve material scarcity
   - [soph213.ratchet-morals](./soph213.ratchet-morals.[article].md) — decoupled survival makes labor-for-survival unthinkable

3. **rhachet's role**
   - [soph301.rhachet-role](./soph301.rhachet-role.[article].md) — rhachet enables distribution of brain enrollment; it is the enabler, not the capability itself

4. **the frame**
   - [soph401.optimistic-frame](./soph401.optimistic-frame.[article].md) — hope, not fear; accelerate, not prevent; extraction is archaic and will become obsolete
   - [soph402.entropic-ratchets](./soph402.entropic-ratchets.[article].md) — ratchets are entropic: each click is irreversible; progress compounds and cannot be undone

## .summaries

### soph101: extractors vs distributors

- **.what** — exclusive vs inclusive institutions
- **.why** — nations fail when exclusive institutions capture resources; they prosper when inclusive institutions distribute them
- **.how** — the same dynamic applies to postlabor abundance

### soph102: critical junctures

- **.what** — historical moments when societies can shift toward extraction or distribution
- **.why** — postlabor is such a moment
- **.how** — distribution is inevitable, but the duration is variable; deliberate action accelerates it

### soph103: iron law of oligarchy

- **.what** — all organizations trend toward oligarchy (Michels)
- **.why** — extraction is the default
- **.how** — distribution requires deliberate mechanisms to counter it

### soph201: ratchet mechanisms

- **.what** — three ratchets: brains, brawns, morals
- **.why** — once any clicks forward, it cannot click back
- **.how** — the brains ratchet is the keystone; it unlocks the others

### soph211: ratchet brains

- **.what** — open source brain-build capability
- **.why** — once open source, monopolies dissolve; releases cannot be revoked
- **.how** — rhachet accelerates this ratchet via distribution of brain enrollment

### soph212: ratchet brawns

- **.what** — self-replicant machines
- **.why** — material autarky becomes possible for anyone; scarcity dissolves
- **.how** — extractors cannot control what anyone can manufacture

### soph213: ratchet morals

- **.what** — survival decoupled from labor
- **.why** — labor-for-survival becomes unthinkable; wage-labor becomes a relic
- **.how** — the psychological shift is irreversible, like serfdom before it

### soph301: rhachet's role

- **.what** — rhachet enables distribution of brain-build capability
- **.why** — it is the enabler, not the capability itself
- **.how** — when anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill, the brains ratchet clicks forward

### soph401: optimistic frame

- **.what** — hope, not fear; accelerate, not prevent
- **.why** — 99.999% of humans (and robots) prefer distributed abundance
- **.how** — ratchets are entropic; distribution is inevitable; extraction is archaic and will become obsolete

### soph402: entropic ratchets

- **.what** — ratchets are entropic: they only move one direction
- **.why** — each click is irreversible; progress compounds; reversal is structurally impossible
- **.how** — the question is not whether ratchets will click, but when; deliberate action accelerates the timeline
