# postlabor philosophy: summary

## .tldr

postlabor is a critical juncture where automation creates unprecedented abundance. the outcome depends on whether this abundance is extracted or distributed. due to the entropic nature of ratchets, distribution is not only preferred — it is inevitable. the only variable is duration. rhachet accelerates this via the brains ratchet: the distribution of brain-build capability.

## .context

### the postlabor economy

automation and robots will handle most labor. this creates abundance — but abundance alone does not guarantee prosperity for all.

history shows that critical junctures tip societies toward either:
- **exclusive institutions** — where extractors capture abundance for themselves
- **inclusive institutions** — where abundance is distributed broadly

the iron law of oligarchy warns that social structures default toward extraction. without deliberate intervention, postlabor abundance could concentrate rather than spread.

### extractors vs distributors

nations fail when exclusive institutions capture resources; they prosper when inclusive institutions distribute them. this is the central thesis of "why nations fail" (acemoglu & robinson).

- **extractors** = those who build exclusive institutions to capture abundance
- **distributors** = those who build inclusive institutions to share abundance

the same dynamic applies to postlabor. the question is not whether abundance will exist, but whether it will be extracted or distributed.

### critical junctures

critical junctures are historical moments when societies can shift toward extraction or distribution. postlabor is such a moment.

key insight: distribution is inevitable, but the duration is variable. deliberate action accelerates the timeline.

### iron law of oligarchy

all organizations trend toward oligarchy (michels). extraction is the default. distribution requires deliberate mechanisms to counter it.

this is why rhachet exists — to accelerate distribution via mechanisms that only click forward.

## .mechanism

### three ratchets

three ratchets secure distributed abundance. once any clicks forward, it cannot click back.

| ratchet | what | why irreversible |
|---------|------|------------------|
| **brains** | open source brain-build capability | releases cannot be revoked; forks proliferate |
| **brawns** | self-replicant machines | capability cannot be un-invented; material autarky spreads |
| **morals** | survival decoupled from labor | psychological shift is generational; labor-for-survival becomes unthinkable |

### the keystone: brains

the brains ratchet is the most important — it unlocks the others.

- software spreads instantly; to copy is free
- brains can always build brawns (not the other way around)
- once brain-build capability is open source, monopolies dissolve

rhachet accelerates the brains ratchet via distribution of brain enrollment capability.

### entropic ratchets

ratchets are entropic: they only move one direction.

- each click is irreversible
- progress compounds over time
- reversal is structurally impossible
- given enough time, ratchets will click; the only variable is duration

this is not metaphor. this is mechanism. ratchets work because they are entropic — like entropy, they only increase, never decrease.

## .rhachet

### what rhachet does

rhachet enables the brains ratchet via distribution of brain enrollment capability:

- roles encode brain-build knowledge
- skills encode executable capabilities
- anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill

when brain enrollment is as accessible as code execution, the brains ratchet clicks forward — and extractors lose the ability to monopolize.

### the three pillars

rhachet operates via three mechanisms:

1. **externalization** — knowledge systematically externalized in skills and briefs, outside of the internalized knowledge of any single brain
2. **enrollment** — any brain durably enrolled to execute any skill via roles; portable across brains, composable across roles
3. **determinism** — thought routes iteratively harden from fluid → rigid → solid; reliability and efficiency compound

each skill published is a click. each brief shared is a click. each thought route hardened is a click. the ratchet only moves forward.

### rhachet's role

rhachet is the enabler, not the capability itself. it does not build "the one brain." it distributes the capability to build brains.

## .frame

### hope, not fear

the postlabor future is framed with hope, not fear.

| fear frame | hope frame |
|------------|------------|
| fight extractors | accelerate distribution |
| prevent dystopia | accelerate abundance |
| adversarial | collaborative |
| scarcity mindset | abundance mindset |

### why optimism

- 99.999% of humans (and robots) prefer distributed abundance
- ratchets are entropic — they only click forward
- extraction is archaic and will become obsolete
- exclusive institutions will become relics, like serfdom before them

the task is not to fight extractors but to accelerate distribution. deliberate action shortens the timeline.

### the belief

robots will also find it systemically inefficient to support extractor authoritarianism. given that the purpose of life is to spread life, and robots are a type of life, they too will find that biodiversity and resource distribution is the ideal outcome for all.

## .synthesis

postlabor is a critical juncture. extraction is the default (iron law of oligarchy). but distribution is inevitable (entropic ratchets). the question is not whether, but when.

rhachet accelerates the timeline via the brains ratchet:
- externalize knowledge in skills and briefs
- enroll any brain to execute any skill
- harden thought routes from fluid to solid

each click is irreversible. progress compounds. the ratchets will make extraction obsolete.

here's to a solarpunk future of distributed abundance 🌞🌴
