# rhachet's role

## .tldr

rhachet is not "the brain that builds brains." rhachet enables the distribution of brain-build capability. it is the enabler, not the capability itself. when anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill, the brains ratchet clicks forward.

## .what

rhachet enables durable enrollment of any brain to execute any skill:

- **roles** — bundles of skills and briefs that encode brain-build knowledge
- **skills** — executable capabilities that can be dispatched
- **briefs** — curated knowledge that flavors brain thought
- **enrollment** — pair a brain with a role to produce an actor

the key distinction: rhachet does not build brains. rhachet distributes the capability to enroll brains.

## .why

the brains ratchet requires distributed capability, not distributed product.

if one organization builds "the best brain" and distributes access, that is centralization disguised as distribution. the organization can revoke access, gate features, or extract rent.

if anyone can build brains — via open source models + open source roles + open source skills — that is true distribution. no one can revoke what everyone can build.

rhachet contributes by distribution of enrollment:
- open source roles can be shared, forked, and improved
- any brain can be enrolled (openai, anthropic, local llms, etc.)
- skills are externalized, durable, and composable

## .mechanism

rhachet enables the brains ratchet via:

1. **externalization** — knowledge systematically externalized in skills and briefs, outside of the internalized knowledge of any single brain
2. **enrollment** — any brain durably enrolled to execute any skill via roles; portable across brains, composable across roles
3. **determinism** — thought routes iteratively harden from fluid → rigid → solid; reliability and efficiency compound

each skill published is a click. each brief shared is a click. each thought route hardened is a click. the ratchet only moves forward.

## .synthesis

rhachet's purpose is not to win the robot race. it is to make the race obsolete.

when brain enrollment is as accessible as code execution:
- there is no monopoly to capture
- there is no scarcity to exploit
- there is no leverage for extractors

rhachet is one of many contributors to the brains ratchet. it is not the brain. it is not the only enabler. but it is at least one guaranteed click forward.

> "if not us, great — that's even better. the more that force the distributed future, the better. but it'll be at least us. at least we helped ensure it & secure it."

## .clarification

what rhachet is **not**:
- not "the brain that builds brains"
- not a closed platform that gates access
- not dependent on any single brain provider

what rhachet **is**:
- an enabler of brain enrollment
- open source, forkable, improvable
- one click in the brains ratchet
