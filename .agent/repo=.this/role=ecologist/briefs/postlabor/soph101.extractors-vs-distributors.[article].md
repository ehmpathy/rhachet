# extractors vs distributors

## .tldr

nations fail when exclusive institutions capture resources for the few. nations prosper when inclusive institutions distribute resources to the many. the same dynamic applies to postlabor abundance.

## .what

"Why Nations Fail" by Acemoglu and Robinson distinguishes two types of institutions:

**exclusive institutions** — structured to extract resources from the many by the few
- cement elite power without checks and balances
- discourage innovation (threatens existing power)
- create vicious cycles that reinforce extraction

**inclusive institutions** — distribute power and opportunity broadly
- enforce property rights and create level play fields
- encourage investment and innovation
- create virtuous cycles that reinforce distribution

## .why

postlabor abundance will be governed by institutions. the question is: will those institutions extract or distribute?

if exclusive: technofeudalism — robo abundance captured by a few, the rest reduced to "cloud serfs"

if inclusive: distributed abundance — anyone can access the capability to build and benefit

rhachet aims to make distribution irreversible via the brains ratchet.

## .claims

> [1] "nations fail because their exclusive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate." — ref.1

> [2] "inclusive economic institutions that enforce property rights, create a level playing field, and encourage investments in new technologies and skills are more conducive to economic growth than exclusive economic institutions that are structured to extract resources from the many by the few." — ref.1

> [4] exclusive institutions are "structured to extract resources from the many by the few" — ref.1

> [6] "exclusive institutions trap [nations] in a vicious cycle. the cycle begins when an elite establishes political institutions to enrich themselves, by consolidating state power in their own hands without meaningful checks and balances." — ref.1

> [9] "virtuous cycles can help bend the long arc of history toward growth and prosperity" — ref.1

## .synthesis

the extractors vs distributors frame maps directly to postlabor futures:

| exclusive future | inclusive future |
|-------------------|------------------|
| robots captured by few | robots distributed to many |
| technofeudalism | collective abundance |
| cloud serfs | empowered creators |
| vicious cycle | virtuous cycle |

rhachet's role: accelerate the inevitable — click the distribution ratchet forward via distributed brain-build capability.
