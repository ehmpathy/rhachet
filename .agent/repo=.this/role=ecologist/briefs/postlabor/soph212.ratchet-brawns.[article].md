# ratchet: brawns

## .tldr

the brawns ratchet: once self-replicant machines exist, material autarky becomes possible for anyone. scarcity of physical goods dissolves. extractors cannot control what anyone can manufacture.

## .what

the brawns ratchet clicks when:
- machines can build copies of themselves
- raw materials are abundantly accessible
- physical production capacity spreads beyond control

Von Neumann conceived self-replicant automata in 1948. the concept: a machine that can read a description of itself and construct a copy.

> [77] "a detailed conceptual proposal for a self-replicant machine was first put forward by mathematician John von Neumann in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a kinematic model of self-reproduce automata as a thought experiment." — ref.8

## .why

knowledge alone is insufficient if physical production remains scarce. the brawns ratchet complements the brains ratchet.

> [80] "von Neumann argued that the most effective way to perform large-scale mine operations such as mine of an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by self-replicant spacecraft, which takes advantage of their exponential growth." — ref.8

> [81] "given enough construction materials, such a robot could multiply exponentially — one robot copies itself into another robot, two robots become four, four robots become eight, and so on." — ref.8

once self-replicant capacity exists:
- anyone with one machine has infinite machines
- material scarcity becomes a choice, not a constraint
- extractors cannot monopolize physical production

## .claims

> [78] "von Neumann's goal was to design a machine whose complexity could grow automatically akin to biological organisms under natural selection." — ref.8

> [79] "in his design, the self-replicant machine consists of three parts: a 'description' of itself, a universal constructor mechanism that can read any description and construct the machine that the description encoded, and a universal copy machine that can make copies of any description." — ref.8

> [82] "imagine an unmanned space probe that could explore the galaxy while also harvest of raw materials from pass of asteroids and planets to build copies of itself. we would only need a few dozen generations of these probes before we could assign a single probe to each of the 250 billion stars in the Milky Way." — ref.8

> [83] "in 1980, NASA conducted a joint summer study with ASEE entitled 'Advanced Automation for Space Missions' to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicant factories to develop lunar resources without require of additional launches or human workers on-site." — ref.8

## .current state

> [84] "through a technology analysis, it was concluded that the current maturity of artificial intelligence, additive manufacture, and asteroid resource harvest technologies hinder the development of a completely self-replicant probe. however, partially self-replicant probes are feasible." — ref.8

the brawns ratchet is not yet ready to click. but the trajectory is clear. when it does click, material abundance becomes irreversible.

## .synthesis

the brawns ratchet is longer-term than the brains ratchet. rhachet focuses on the brains ratchet because:
- it can click now (software, not hardware)
- it accelerates the brawns ratchet (brain-build enables machine-build)
- it is the necessary precursor (you need the knowledge to build the machines)

secure the brains ratchet first. the brawns ratchet follows.
