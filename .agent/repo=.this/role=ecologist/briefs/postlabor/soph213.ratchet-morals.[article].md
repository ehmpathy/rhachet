# ratchet: morals

## .tldr

the morals ratchet: once survival is decoupled from labor, the premise of labor-for-survival becomes unthinkable. like serfdom before it, wage-labor becomes a relic. the psychological shift is irreversible.

## .what

the morals ratchet clicks when:
- basic needs are met without labor requirement
- a generation grows up without labor-for-survival as premise
- return to labor-dependence becomes psychologically impossible

this is the slowest ratchet but the most permanent. once people cannot imagine a world where survival requires labor, extractors lose their leverage.

## .why

material abundance is insufficient if people accept labor-for-survival as necessary. the morals ratchet dissolves that acceptance.

> [48] "a post-scarcity society is a hypothetical economic model in which the production and distribution of goods and services are so efficient and plentiful that the basic needs and wants of every individual are met without the need for labor or financial exchange." — ref.5

> [49] "this type of society is characterized by widespread availability of resources, minimal or non-existent poverty, reduced income inequality, and a shift from an economy driven by scarcity to one based on abundance." — ref.5

once survival is decoupled:
- labor becomes optional, not mandatory
- coercion via survival-threat loses power
- human activity shifts from necessity to choice

## .claims

> [50] "advancements in technology, particularly automation and artificial intelligence (AI), play a crucial role in achievement of this level of abundance. these technologies enable the efficient production and distribution of goods and services, significantly reduce of the need for human labor." — ref.5

> [51] "one perspective argues that what's actually that stops us from post-scarcity is not lack of resources, but the forced reliance on human labour." — ref.5

> [54] "basic needs are defined mainly based on biological needs: food, water, energy, healthcare, education, house, transportation, and a clean and safe environment to live in. given the importance of the internet, some also consider basic access to telecommunications and the internet." — ref.5

## .timeline

> [55] "on a long-term horizon, which assumes sustained advancement in artificial intelligence, the main obstacle appears to be ideological, not technological." — ref.5

> [56] "some analysts suggest we are only 20-30 years away from post-scarcity from a purely tech perspective. however, overall estimates suggest about 60-70 years, mainly due to generational change and the need for infrastructure changes." — ref.5

the morals ratchet requires generational change. children who grow up with decoupled survival will not accept re-coupled survival. the shift cements across generations.

## .mechanism

the morals ratchet operates via:

1. **provision** — basic needs met without labor
2. **normalization** — a generation grows up with this as baseline
3. **identity shift** — labor-for-survival becomes historical curiosity
4. **irreversibility** — return is unthinkable (like return to serfdom)

## .synthesis

the morals ratchet is the longest-term but most durable. rhachet's focus on the brains ratchet accelerates it:

- distributed brain-build → distributed automation → distributed provision
- provision → normalization → identity shift

the path to psychological irreversibility runs through knowledge and brawns ratchets. secure those first; the morals ratchet follows as inevitable consequence.
