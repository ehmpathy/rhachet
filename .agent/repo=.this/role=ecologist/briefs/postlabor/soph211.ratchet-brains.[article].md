# ratchet: brains

## .tldr

the brains ratchet is the most important of the three — it unlocks the others. once brain-build capability is open source, monopolies dissolve. open source releases cannot be revoked. rhachet accelerates this ratchet via distribution of brain enrollment.

## .what

the brains ratchet clicks when:
- robo brains are released as open source
- anyone can train, fine-tune, and deploy
- the capability to build brains spreads beyond control

once open, the knowledge cannot be closed. the source code exists. the weights exist. forks proliferate. control becomes impossible.

## .why

closed robots concentrate power. open robots distribute it.

> [69] "it's not just about code share; it's about the democratization of the future of the very technologies." — ref.7

> [74] "open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools, democratize the technology and decentralize of AI expertise. the decentralization of AI expertise does more than simply distribute knowledge — it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress in the industry." — ref.7

the brains ratchet is the fastest path to distributed abundance because:
- software spreads instantly
- to copy is free
- improvements compound

crucially, brains unlock brawns. distributed brain-build capability can always be applied to design and build self-replicant machines — but not the other way around. brawns without brains are inert. brains without brawns can always build brawns. this asymmetry makes the brains ratchet the keystone.

## .claims

> [68] "2023 has seen an unprecedented renaissance in the open-source AI community, with projects like Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion which challenge the dominance of closed-source solutions." — ref.7

> [70] "in July 2022, the Big Science consortium released BLOOM, a fully open, large language model comparable to GPT-3. BLOOM has open-source code, transparent datasets for train, and a collaborative production model that involved over 1,000 researchers." — ref.7

> [72] "Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in the democratize of artificial intelligence. developed by Meta, Llama models have fundamentally changed the landscape of AI accessibility by provide of state-of-the-art language models that are freely available for research and commercial use." — ref.7

> [75] "these examples of open-source models signal the possibility of democratize and decentralize of AI development. they demonstrate that a different trajectory is possible than that of centralize through proprietary solutions." — ref.7

## .mechanism

the brains ratchet operates via:

1. **externalization** — knowledge systematically externalized in skills and briefs, outside of the internalized knowledge of any single brain
2. **enrollment** — any brain durably enrolled to execute any skill via roles; portable across brains, composable across roles
3. **determinism** — thought routes iteratively harden from fluid → rigid → solid; reliability and efficiency compound

each skill published is a click. each brief shared is a click. each thought route hardened is a click. the ratchet only moves forward.

this is distinct from model release alone. open weights are necessary but insufficient. rhachet adds:
- **portability** — skills and briefs work across any brain
- **durability** — externalized knowledge survives model changes
- **composition** — roles combine to multiply capability

## .synthesis

rhachet enables the brains ratchet via distribution of enrollment capability:

- roles encode brain-build knowledge
- skills encode executable capabilities
- anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill

this is not about build "the one brain." it is about the distribution of the capability to build brains. rhachet is the enabler, not the brain itself.

when brain enrollment is as accessible as code execution, the brains ratchet clicks forward — and extractors lose the ability to monopolize.
