# critical junctures

## .tldr

critical junctures are historical moments when societies can shift toward extraction or distribution. postlabor is such a moment — the outcome is not predetermined.

## .what

a critical juncture is a disruptive event that transforms societies. the same event can lead to opposite outcomes based on existing institutional differences.

key characteristics:
- highly disruptive to existing power structures
- creates opportunity for institutional change
- outcome depends on pre-existing conditions and choices made
- effects compound over time (institutional drift)

## .why

postlabor — the transition to an economy where robots handle most labor — is a critical juncture. it disrupts:
- employment as the basis for survival
- human labor as the source of value
- existing power structures built on labor control

this disruption can tip toward extraction (elites capture robots) or distribution (robo capability spreads). the tipping point depends on choices made.

## .claims

> [10] "critical junctures are highly disruptive historical events that transform societies politically, socially, and economically. classic examples are the Black Death and the Industrial Revolution." — ref.1

> [11] "a critical juncture is a double-edged sword that can cause a sharp turn in the trajectory of a nation. on the one hand it can open the way for breaking the cycle of exclusive institutions and enable more inclusive ones to emerge, as in England. or it can intensify the emergence of exclusive institutions, as was the case with the Second Serfdom in Eastern Europe." — ref.1

> [12] "nations often diverge over time precisely because their institutions respond to the same critical junctures in different ways." — ref.1

## .examples

### the Black Death (1346-1353)

the plague killed half of Europe's population. same event, divergent outcomes:

**Western Europe** — tipped toward inclusion
- labor scarcity gave peasants power
- feudal system weakened
- led toward the Glorious Revolution and Industrial Revolution

**Eastern Europe** — tipped toward extraction
- lords tightened control ("Second Serfdom")
- peasants lost rights
- exclusive institutions intensified

> [13] "the Black Death spread across Europe in the 1300s, killing roughly half its population and fundamentally transforming its societies." — ref.1

> [14] the plague "multiplied existing institutional differences, leading to a major divergence" between Western and Eastern Europe — ref.1

### the Glorious Revolution (1688)

Parliament replaced the monarchy's absolute power with distributed political control.

> [15] "the Glorious Revolution was a brief conflict between the British monarchy and Parliament in 1688. Parliament was victorious—it replaced King James II and, more importantly, took over all real authority from the monarchy." — ref.1

> [17] Acemoglu and Robinson view the Glorious Revolution as "the turning point that built inclusive institutions in Britain and enabled the Industrial Revolution to take off there" — ref.1

### postlabor (now)

robots and automation disrupt labor as the basis for survival. same disruption, potential outcomes:

**exclusive outcome** — technofeudalism
- robo capability captured by few tech giants
- masses become "cloud serfs" (Varoufakis, ref.3)
- new feudal hierarchy emerges

**inclusive outcome** — distributed abundance
- robo capability distributed broadly
- anyone can enroll brains to execute skills
- postlabor abundance shared

## .synthesis

the critical juncture frame reveals that postlabor is not a predetermined slide toward either extraction or distribution. it is a moment of choice — and the choices made now compound over time.

rhachet's contribution: guarantee the ratchet clicks sooner — before any temporary exclusive institutions can take hold. the distributors outcome is inevitable; rhachet accelerates it.
