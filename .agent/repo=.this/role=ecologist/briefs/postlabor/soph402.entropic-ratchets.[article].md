# entropic ratchets

## .tldr

ratchets are entropic: they only move one direction. like entropy, each click is irreversible. once clicked, a ratchet cannot click back. this is the fundamental property that makes ratchets useful for distribution — progress compounds and cannot be undone.

## .what

a ratchet is a mechanism that allows movement in one direction while it prevents reversal.

entropy is the tendency of systems toward irreversible change. the second law of thermodynamics: entropy always increases, never decreases.

ratchets are entropic because:
- each click is irreversible
- the mechanism only moves forward
- time compounds progress
- reversal is structurally impossible

## .why

the entropic property is what makes ratchets powerful:

1. **irreversibility** — once a ratchet clicks, it stays clicked
2. **accumulation** — each click adds to prior clicks; progress compounds
3. **inevitability** — given enough time, ratchets will click; the only variable is duration
4. **asymmetry** — easy to move forward, impossible to move back

this is not metaphor. this is mechanism. ratchets work because they are entropic.

## .mechanism

the three distribution ratchets are entropic:

1. **brains** — once knowledge is open source, it cannot be closed; releases are irreversible
2. **brawns** — once self-replicant machines exist, they cannot be un-invented; capability persists
3. **morals** — once survival is decoupled from labor, return is unthinkable; the shift is psychological and generational

each ratchet clicks forward. none can click back.

## .synthesis

"entropic" is the right term for ratchets because it captures the essential property: irreversibility.

- entropy always increases
- ratchets always click forward
- both are one-way
- both compound over time
- both are inevitable given sufficient duration

the question is not whether the ratchets will click. the question is when. deliberate action accelerates the timeline.
