# ratchet mechanisms

## .tldr

three ratchets can secure distributed abundance: brains (open source brain-build), brawns (self-replicant swarms), and morals (decoupled survival). once any clicks forward, it cannot click back. the brains ratchet is the keystone — it unlocks the others.

## .what

a ratchet is a mechanism that allows movement in one direction while it prevents reversal. in economics:

> [41] "the ratchet effect is a concept in sociology and economics illustrating the difficulty with reversing a course of action once a specific thing has occurred, analogous with the mechanical ratchet that allows movement in one direction and seizes or tightens in the opposite." — ref.4

applied to postlabor distribution, three ratchets can make abundance irreversible:

1. **brains ratchet** — once brain-build capability is open source, it cannot be un-open-sourced
2. **brawns ratchet** — once self-replicant swarms exist, material autarky cannot be revoked
3. **morals ratchet** — once survival is decoupled from labor, return to labor-dependence is unthinkable

## .why

the iron law of oligarchy warns that extraction is the default. critical junctures can tip either way. ratchets are the answer: mechanisms that make distribution irreversible.

each ratchet represents a different domain:
- brains → who can build brains
- brawns → who can access materials
- morals → who accepts labor as necessary

secure any one, and extraction becomes structurally difficult. secure all three, and distributed abundance becomes inevitable.

## .the three ratchets

### 1. brains ratchet (keystone)

when brain-build capability becomes open source, monopolies dissolve. this is the most important ratchet — it unlocks the others.

- open source models cannot be un-released
- knowledge spreads faster than it can be controlled
- anyone can fork, improve, and share

rhachet enables this ratchet via distribution of brain enrollment capability.

### 2. brawns ratchet

when self-replicant machines exist, material scarcity becomes obsolete.

- one machine builds two; two build four
- raw materials exist abundantly (asteroids, moons, planets)
- physical autarky becomes possible for anyone

→ see [soph212.ratchet-brawns](./soph212.ratchet-brawns.[article].md)

### 3. morals ratchet

when survival no longer requires labor, the premise of labor-for-survival becomes unthinkable.

- once basic needs are met without labor, return is psychologically impossible
- similar to how medirhachet completion --setupserfdom is now unthinkable
- generational change cements the shift

## .synthesis

rhachet focuses on the brains ratchet — the keystone that unlocks the others. brains can always be applied to design and build brawns, but not the other way around. brawns without brains are inert; brains without brawns can always build brawns. this asymmetry makes the brains ratchet the priority.

the brains ratchet is also the most immediately actionable. brawns ratchets require hardware advances. morals ratchets require generational change. but brains ratchets can click forward now, via open source brain-build distribution.

each ratchet that clicks reduces the attack surface for extractors. the goal is not to win a race but to make the race obsolete.
