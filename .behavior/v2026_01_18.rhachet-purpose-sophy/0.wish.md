formalize the philosophy behind rhachet

specifically, why its critical and why its important

and what our hope for what it guarantees is

---

note: we dont care whether this is what causes the destination

we only care that this guarantees its possible

if not us, great - that's even better. the more that force the distributed future, the better.

but it'll be atleast us. atleast we helped ensure it & secure it.

---

specifically, its around

- why the `ratchet` is what this project is named after
- how the `ratchet` is relevant to a distributed future of abundance
- why a distributed future of abundance is important to ensure

---

the core why, why a **distributed** future of abundance is critical, is based on what is really well outlined within the book 'why nations fail' && the concept of the 'iron law of oligarchy'

by default, social structures evolve with a vicious cycle that cements extractors over the rest of the population.

we'll want you to distill a brief that extracts, independently, the core relevant quotes from each book and summarize their contents.

---

next, we'll want you to take a look at the briefs on the postlabor economy and how postlabor is a critical juncture.

either,
- the world shifts into an 'extractor' dominated future (e.g., techno-feudalism)
- the world shifts into a 'distributor' dominated future (e.g., collective abundance)

specifically, there are key ratchets that unleash a guarantee for the distributor's future.

and the purpose of rhachet is to guarantee atleast the first one.

---

at the very high level, the ratchet metaphor operates at two targets
1. ratchet incremental improvement of thought routes;
   1. -> guaranteed slipless iterative improvement of capabilities of actors via brain enrollment
   2. via externalized knowledge, incremented determinism, and durable enrollemnt
2. ratchet guarante the distributors future of a postlabor economy
   1. via distribution of the brain that builds brains
   2. => distribute the capacity to do good.
   3. underpinned by the philosophy that the good greatly outweight the bad. and with unlimited brains to all, (inifinite-good)^n will outweigh (inifite-bad)^(n-1) (n-1 since bad.quant < good.quant)


---

our outcome goal is to create some briefs and update the root readme.md minimally

the briefs can be thorough

.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/*

the readme should be compact

we already have a section in there on "solarpunk future of abundance"

we just want to more explicitly tie it into the ratchet metaphor, given this clear relationship above, that this repo enables the ratchet of one of the key ratchets that guarantee the distributor's postlabor future of abundance, rather than the extractors postlabor future of exclusion

---

further, it should be clear that we assume 99.999% of humans feel the same way

we also assume that robots will also find it systemically inefficient to support an extractors authoritarianism. i.e., given the purpose of life is to spread life, and robots are a type of life, they too will find that biodiversity and a distribution of resources to life is the ideal outcome for all


so, we think that this is the inevitable future. and that exclusive institutions will be a relic of the past. but we're here to help ensure it. it'll be atleast us that guarantees it. (but hopefully and probably, many more than us too)

reference these docs as the background for the postlabor thoughts

reference this book

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail

Why Nations Fail
Book by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson


as the background on
- extractors = what they call (captured control, exclusive institutions, etc)
- distributors = what they call (inclusive insitutions, pluralism, etc)


----

we want to extract the key claims from each reference as briefs into
.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/*

then, we also want to supply supplemental researched refererces too


---

and specifically, rhachet is not a "brain that builds brains"

instead, it unlocks "brain that builds brains" distribution

rhachet enables durable enrollment of any brain.atom to gain the capacity to execute any skill. (e.g., the skill to build brains)

---

we want a progressive sequence of knowledge in the briefs dir

start with the overview and then breakout into details

checkout how the bhrain repo's briefs are decomposed

e.g., exemplified and articutated in the docs of https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhrain/tree/main/src/domain.roles/thinker/briefs/knowledge (access via gh api)

  its not a race. we believe the distributors outcome is inevitable. we just
  want to guarantee that ratchet tooth clicks into place sooner than later,
  before any temporary exclusive institutions can begin to take hold
