# blueprint: rhachet purpose sophy

architecture and implementation plan to formalize the philosophy behind rhachet.

---

# overview

## goal

formalize why rhachet is named after "ratchet" — the dual metaphor that operates at two levels:

1. **ratchet.1 (capability)**: slipless iterative improvement of thought routes
   - via externalized knowledge (briefs), incremented determinism (skills), durable enrollment (actors)

2. **ratchet.2 (purpose)**: guarantee the distributors' postlabor future of abundance
   - via distribution of the "brain that builds brains" capability
   - rhachet enables anyone to enroll any brain.atom to execute any skill, brain-build included

# brief specifications

## postlabor briefs

### pol101.overview.[article].md

**purpose**: introduce postlabor as a critical juncture

**structure**:
```markdown
# postlabor: a critical juncture

## .what
postlabor = economic state where human labor is not required for survival.

## .why it matters
postlabor represents a critical juncture in human history — a moment where societies can diverge dramatically based on institutional responses.

## .the fork
| path                | outcome              | dominant philosophy |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| extractor capture   | techno-feudalism     | value capture       |
| distributor success | collective abundance | common heritage     |

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "critical junctures are highly disruptive historical events that transform societies politically, socially, and economically." [ref.1, citation 10]

**commentary**: postlabor is such a critical juncture — the arrival of robot brains that can solve any problem is as transformative as the black death or industrial revolution.

### [claim.2]
> "a critical juncture is a double-edged sword that can cause a sharp turn in the trajectory of a nation." [ref.1, citation 11]

**commentary**: postlabor can either cement extractor dominance (techno-feudalism) or enable distributor success (collective abundance).

## .frame
optimistic: this is not dystopian inevitability. 99.999% of humans want abundance. the distributors' success is the more probable outcome — we are here to help ensure it.
```

### pol201.extractors.[article].md

**purpose**: explain extractor philosophy and mechanisms

**structure**:
```markdown
# extractors: value capture philosophy

## .what
extractors view productive capacity (robot brains included) as proprietary assets. their goal: maintain traditional power dynamics via artificial bottlenecks.

## .mechanisms

### toll-gate economics
even when production cost is $0, extractors place license fees or access taxes on output.

### vertical integration
own the entire stack: energy (fusion), brain (compute), muscle (robot swarms).

### planned irrelevance
design products that require proprietary updates to ensure population dependency.

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "extractive economic institutions [...] are structured to extract resources from the many by the few." [ref.1, citation 4]

### [claim.2]
> "extractive political institutions cement the elite power base and support extractive economic institutions." [ref.1, citation 5]

### [claim.3]
> "the power of techno-feudalists arises when they extract human data to shape our preferences." [ref.3, citation 36]

## .historical pattern

### [claim.4]
> "extractive institutions trap [nations] in a vicious cycle. the cycle begins when an elite establishes political institutions to enrich themselves." [ref.1, citation 6]
```

### pol202.distributors.[article].md

**purpose**: explain distributor philosophy and mechanisms

**structure**:
```markdown
# distributors: common heritage philosophy

## .what
distributors view productive capacity as a public utility — like oxygen or the internet. their goal: maximize the velocity of abundance.

## .mechanisms

### open-loop systems
"right to repair" and "right to print" — any citizen can use local robot swarms to create what they need.

### modular infrastructure
mesh network of smaller, localized brains that operate independently of central authority.

### abundance index
measure success by "cost of basic survival" — the lower the cost, the better.

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "inclusive economic institutions that enforce property rights, create a level field, and encourage investments in new technologies and skills are more conducive to economic growth." [ref.1, citation 2]

### [claim.2]
> "inclusive political institutions distribute political power widely in a pluralistic manner." [ref.1, citation 7]

### [claim.3]
> "virtuous cycles can help bend the long arc of history toward growth and prosperity." [ref.1, citation 9]

## .solarpunk vision

### [claim.4]
> "at the heart of Solarpunk is a simple idea: that technology can enhance our connection with nature, rather than destroy it." [ref.6, citation 60]

### [claim.5]
> "solarpunk recognizes that the climate crisis is a social justice issue." [ref.6, citation 67]
```

### pol203.extractors-vs-distributors.[article].md

**purpose**: explain the competition for postlabor

**structure**:
```markdown
# the great friction: extractors vs distributors

## .what
in postlabor, the economy is no longer about scarcity but about access. the conflict arises between two philosophies of how automated output should flow.

## .the three pillars of power

the winner is decided by who controls these pillars:

| pillar            | extractor strategy                               | distributor strategy                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| compute (brain)   | centralized data centers, "safety" laws          | distributed edge compute, sovereign personal ai |
| energy (fuel)     | centralized grids with killswitch                | decoupled local micro-grids                     |
| matter (material) | control over extraction rights, material credits | circular local recycle swarms                   |

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "the Extractor's primary tool of governance—the carrot of wages and the stick of poverty—becomes a broken tool." [postlabor.v4]

### [claim.2]
> "if the Brain is truly 'perfect,' it may find that the Extractor model is mathematically unstable (it leads to revolution/system failure)." [postlabor.v3]

## .the hybrid crisis
history suggests transition won't be clean — likely a dual-tiered economy:

1. **distributor tier (floor)**: baseline "free" deliverables via public robot swarms
2. **extractor tier (roof)**: luxury market for "human-curated" or "ultra-high-compute" solutions
```

### pol301.ratchets.overview.[article].md

**purpose**: introduce the three ratchet mechanisms

**structure**:
```markdown
# three ratchet mechanisms

## .what
a ratchet allows movement in one direction only. once clicked into place, these mechanisms cannot be reversed — they are existential threats to the extractor model.

## .the three ratchets

| ratchet       | mechanism              | result                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| knowledge     | open-source brain leak | monopoly on problem-solve dies               |
| physical      | self-replicant swarms  | means of production becomes invasive species |
| psychological | decoupled survival     | "earn a life" vanishes from human psyche     |

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "the ratchet effect is a concept [...] that illustrates the difficulty to reverse a course of action once a specific event has occurred." [ref.4, citation 41]

### [claim.2]
> "once the Brain is unleashed and the swarms are self-replicated, the marginal cost of existence trends toward zero, which makes the Extractor model mathematically and socially obsolete." [postlabor.v4]

## .relationship to rhachet
rhachet unlocks the first ratchet — the brains ratchet. by enable of durable enrollment of any brain to execute any skill, rhachet distributes the "brain that builds brains."
```

### pol302.ratchets.knowledge.[article].md

**purpose**: detail the brains ratchet

**structure**:
```markdown
# the brains ratchet

## .what
if the "robot brain" software is leaked or even one high-function version is released open-source, the extractor's monopoly on problem-solve dies instantly.

## .mechanisms

### replication
unlike a physical factory, a digital brain can be copied at near-zero cost.

### the hydra effect
you can shut down a central server, but you cannot shut down a million instances that run on decentralized edge hardware.

### result
once the "blueprint for blueprints" is public, the ability to solve any problem becomes a fundamental human capability — like fire or literacy.

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "to make AI tools, technology, and expertise available to a wider range of individuals and organizations [...] is known as 'AI democratization.'" [ref.7, citation 73]

### [claim.2]
> "these examples of open-source models signal the possibility to democratize and decentralize AI development." [ref.7, citation 75]

### [claim.3]
> "2023 has seen an unprecedented renaissance in the open-source AI community, with projects like Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion that challenge the dominance of closed-source solutions." [ref.7, citation 68]

## .how rhachet contributes
rhachet is not a "brain that builds brains" — it is the framework that enables **distribution** of that capability:

- durable enrollment of any brain.atom to execute any skill
- externalized knowledge (briefs) that can be shared, composed, open-sourced
- roles that encode institutional knowledge independent of any specific brain

rhachet ensures the brains ratchet clicks into place by make of brain-build capability composable and distributable.
```

### pol303.ratchets.physical.[article].md

**purpose**: detail the brawns ratchet

**structure**:
```markdown
# the brawns ratchet

## .what
if mechanized deliverables include robots that can build more robots, the means of production becomes an invasive species.

## .mechanisms

### exponential growth
if a distributor-led community has 10 robots that can mine, refine, and assemble 10 more robots, they no longer need the extractor's supply chain.

### the "grey goo" of abundance
once a neighborhood has a self-sustained robotic workshop, it becomes an autarky — a self-sufficient entity.

### result
extractors can no longer use starvation or resource throttle as control levers because communities are physically independent.

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "von Neumann argued that the most effective way to perform large-scale operations such as mine of an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by self-replicant spacecraft, to take advantage of their exponential growth." [ref.8, citation 80]

### [claim.2]
> "given enough construction materials, such a robot could multiply exponentially — one robot copies itself into another robot, two robots become four, four robots become eight, and so on." [ref.8, citation 81]

### [claim.3]
> "in 1980, NASA conducted a joint summer study [...] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicant factories to develop lunar resources without require of additional launches or human workers on-site." [ref.8, citation 83]
```

### pol304.ratchets.psychological.[article].md

**purpose**: detail the morals ratchet

**structure**:
```markdown
# the morals ratchet

## .what
once a generation experiences decoupled survival — where food, shelter, and energy are provided as a right — the concept of "earn a life" vanishes from the human psyche.

## .mechanisms

### psychological baseline
you cannot convince a person who grew up with free, robot-printed shelter that they should go back to a 40-hour work week to pay a mortgage.

### social taboo
attempt to re-institutionalize scarcity after abundance would be seen as a crime against humanity, not a "business model."

### result
the extractor's primary tools — the carrot of wages and the stick of poverty — become broken tools.

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "welfare states inevitably face pressure from various social groups and bureaucrats to expand benefits [...] this dynamic leads to the 'ratchet effect,' where welfare allocation continually increases but cannot be reduced without significant political backlash." [ref.4, citation 44]

### [claim.2]
> "when a government introduces a new public service or social welfare program, it creates a certain level of expectation among the beneficiaries. even if the economic conditions change [...] reduce or eliminate of such programs can meet with significant public outrage." [ref.4, citation 45]

### [claim.3]
> "one perspective argues that what's actually a block to post-scarcity is not lack of resources, but the forced reliance on human labour." [ref.5, citation 51]
```

### pol401.endgame.[article].md

**purpose**: describe post-scarcity deflation

**structure**:
```markdown
# the endgame: post-scarcity deflation

## .what
there is a mathematical floor where extraction becomes physically impossible.

## .the deflation cascade

| step      | mechanism                 | impact on extractors              |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1         | brain optimizes energy    | energy costs drop to ~$0.01/kwh   |
| 2         | brain optimizes materials | recycled atoms cheaper than mined |
| 3         | brain optimizes labor     | manufacture cost hits $0          |
| **final** | **price = $0**            | **total market collapse**         |

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "a post-scarcity society is a hypothetical economic model in which the production and distribution of goods and services are so efficient and plentiful that the basic needs and wants of every individual are met without the need for labor or financial exchange." [ref.5, citation 48]

### [claim.2]
> "advancements in technology, particularly automation and artificial intelligence (AI), play a crucial role to achieve this level of abundance." [ref.5, citation 50]

### [claim.3]
> "some analysts suggest we are only 20-30 years away from post-scarcity from a purely tech perspective." [ref.5, citation 56]

## .the scorched earth risk
the only way extractors can "re-leash" pandora's box is through destruction — if they cannot control abundance, they may attempt to destroy the infrastructure to reset society to scarcity.

## .why the distributors win
distribution is a one-way gate. once the brain is unleashed and swarms are self-replicated, the extractor model is mathematically and socially obsolete.
```

## philosophy briefs

### phi101.dual-ratchet-metaphor.[article].md

**purpose**: explain the two levels rhachet operates at

**structure**:
```markdown
# the dual ratchet metaphor

## .what
rhachet is named after "ratchet" — a mechanism that allows movement in one direction only. this metaphor operates at two levels.

## .ratchet.1: capability

### slipless iterative improvement of thought routes

rhachet enables incremental improvement that cannot slip backward:

| mechanism                        | what it ratchets     | result                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| externalized knowledge (briefs)  | institutional wisdom | knowledge persists across brain upgrades |
| incremented determinism (skills) | reliable operations  | complexity compounds safely              |
| durable enrollment (actors)      | reliable thought     | same role works with any brain           |

### how it works
- define a role once → encode institutional knowledge
- enroll any brain → produce an actor
- distill thought routes: fluid → rigid → solid
- each improvement is durable — swap of brains doesn't lose progress

## .ratchet.2: purpose

### guarantee the distributors' postlabor future

rhachet unlocks the brains ratchet — one of three mechanisms that make distributor success irreversible:

| what rhachet distributes              | why it matters                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "brain that builds brains" capability | anyone can create, share, compose actors |
| open-source roles                     | institutional knowledge multiplies       |
| composable thought                    | complexity accessible to all             |

### how it contributes
rhachet is not a "brain that builds brains" — it is the framework that enables **distribution** of that capability. by make of brain enrollment open, composable, and shareable, rhachet clicks the brains ratchet into place.

## .relationship
the two ratchets are connected:
- ratchet.1 (capability improvement) enables individuals and teams to build reliable thought
- ratchet.2 (distributed capability) ensures that capability is available to all

one enables quality. the other ensures access.
together, they guarantee that the tools for abundance are both reliable and widely distributed.

## .frame
we assume 99.999% of humans feel the same way — that abundance should be shared. robots, too, will find that biodiversity and resource distribution are systemically optimal. the extractive model is a relic. rhachet helps ensure it is clear faster.
```

### phi201.knowledge-ratchet-rhachet.[article].md

**purpose**: detail how rhachet enables the brains ratchet

**structure**:
```markdown
# how rhachet enables the brains ratchet

## .context
the brains ratchet is the first of three mechanisms that make distributor success irreversible. once brain software is open, the monopoly dies.

## .what rhachet contributes

### 1. durable enrollment
rhachet separates roles from brains:
- roles encode institutional knowledge (briefs + skills)
- brains are interchangeable inference providers
- enrollment produces actors with reliable behavior

**result**: knowledge persists independent of any specific brain or provider.

### 2. composable thought
rhachet enables composition of thought routes:
- solid (deterministic) → rigid (augmented) → fluid (exploratory)
- skills can call other skills
- actors can orchestrate actors

**result**: complexity compounds safely and accessibly.

### 3. distributable roles
rhachet makes roles shareable:
- package as `rhachet-roles-*` npm packages
- link via `.agent/` directory
- same format for collocated and published roles

**result**: institutional knowledge multiplies via open-source.

## .why this matters for the brains ratchet

the brains ratchet triggers when:
> "the blueprint for blueprints is public"

rhachet contributes by ensure of:
- the blueprint (roles) is composable and shareable
- the builder (brain) is interchangeable
- the result (actors) is reliable and reproducible

when anyone can create, share, and compose actors with reliable thought — the monopoly on problem-solve capability is broken.

## .the hydra effect
rhachet's architecture is inherently distributed:
- no central server required
- roles live in version control
- brains are swappable

you can shut down a provider, but you cannot shut down a million repos with role definitions.
```

### phi301.optimistic-frame.[article].md

**purpose**: establish the optimistic narrative frame

**structure**:
```markdown
# the optimistic frame

## .what
rhachet approaches postlabor from hope, not fear. the distributor future is not just possible — it is probable. we are here to help ensure it.

## .why optimism

### 1. human solidarity
we assume 99.999% of humans want the same outcome — shared abundance over hoarded scarcity.

the extractors are few. the distributors are many. coordination is the challenge, not desire.

### 2. robotic alignment
robots will find that biodiversity and resource distribution are systemically optimal:
- the purpose of life is to spread life
- robots are a type of life
- monoculture (extractor model) is fragile; diversity (distributor model) is durable

a brain asked to "solve for stability" will choose distribution over extraction.

### 3. mathematical inevitability
once the ratchets click into place, the extractor model becomes mathematically obsolete:
- brains ratchet: you cannot un-open-source a brain
- brawns ratchet: you cannot un-teach swarms to replicate
- morals ratchet: you cannot convince abundance-natives to pay for scarcity

## .the frame

### ensure, not fight
rhachet's philosophy is not combative. we are not "against" extractors — we **ensure** the distributor outcome.

the language is constructive:
- "guarantee the positive" not "combat the negative"
- "help ensure" not "prevent"
- "contribute" not "defeat"

### hopeful, not anxious
readers should feel empowered, not dystopian:
- the good outcome is probable
- many more than us will ensure it
- but it'll be at least us

### pragmatic, not preachy
arguments are logical, not emotional:
- claims cite sources
- synthesis is separated from quotation
- skeptics can engage with the logic

## .claims

### [claim.1]
> "the Solarpunk Manifesto calls for 'solutions to live comfortably without fossil fuels, to equitably manage scarcity and share abundance, to be kinder to each other and to the planet we share.'" [ref.6, citation 66]

### [claim.2]
> "in contrast to cyberpunk, which is portrayed as a dark, grim aesthetic, solarpunk is bright, with light often used as a motif." [ref.6, citation 62]

## .key concepts

### extractive institutions
- "structured to extract resources from the many by the few" [citation 4]
- "cement the elite power base" [citation 5]
- create "vicious cycles" [citation 6]

- enable "virtuous cycles" [citation 9]

### critical junctures
- "highly disruptive historical events that transform societies" [citation 10]
- "a double-edged sword that can cause a sharp turn" [citation 11]
- examples: black death, glorious revolution, industrial revolution [citations 13-17]

### institutional drift
- "two otherwise similar societies will slowly drift apart institutionally" [citation 18]
- "historical contingencies function similarly to random mutations" [citation 19]

## .relevance to rhachet

> "this is how capitalism ends: not with a revolutionary bang, but with an evolutionary whimper." [citation 34]

## .key mechanisms

### platform power
> "big tech has replaced capitalism's twin pillars—markets and profit—with its platforms and rents. with every click and scroll, we labor like serfs to increase its power." [citation 35]

### cloud serfdom
> "the power of techno-feudalists arises when they extract human data to shape our preferences." [citation 36]

### algorithmic feedback
> "the cloud has created a feedback loop that removes our agency. we train the algorithm to find what we like and then the algorithm trains us to like what it offers." [citation 37]

## .relevance to rhachet
- technofeudalism is the extractor-dominated AI future
- this is what the distributors compete against
- rhachet enables the alternative: distributed brain-build capability

### ref104.ratchet-effect.[distill].md

**purpose**: distill the economic ratchet concept

**structure**:
```markdown
# distilled: ratchet effect

**source**: Peacock, A.T. & Wiseman, J. (1961). *The Growth of Public Expenditure in the United Kingdom*. Princeton University Press.

## .core concept

> "the ratchet effect is a concept [...] that illustrates the difficulty to reverse a course of action once a specific event has occurred, analogous with the mechanical ratchet that allows movement in one direction and seizes or tightens in the opposite." [citation 41]

## .government application

> "in a crisis, both the magnitude and the range of government activities grow. after the crisis subsides, the overall size of government does not return to its pre-crisis size." [citation 42]

## .welfare state application

> "welfare states inevitably face pressure to expand benefits [...] this dynamic leads to the 'ratchet effect,' where welfare allocations continually increase but cannot be reduced without significant political backlash." [citation 44]

## .irreversibility

> "emergency measures can become entrenched through the ratchet effect, as [...] exceptions [...] fossilize into standard practice long after the initial crisis has passed." [citation 46]

## .relevance to rhachet
- the ratchet metaphor: movement in one direction only
- why distribution is irreversible: once in place, cannot be reversed without backlash
- the three ratchets (knowledge, physical, psychological) apply this mechanism

### from v1: postlabor overview
- robot brains can solve architectural blueprints and mechanized deliverables
- labor becomes "a hobby" — hand-made goods become status symbols
- ownership is the critical pivot: concentrated vs public

### from v2/v3: extractors vs distributors
- extractors: toll-gate economics, vertical integration, planned irrelevance
- distributors: open-loop systems, modular infrastructure, abundance index
- three pillars: compute, energy, matter

### from v4: three ratchets
- brains ratchet: open-source brain leak
- brawns ratchet: self-replicant swarms
- morals ratchet: decoupled survival
- endgame: post-scarcity deflation

# readme update specification

## target section

update the current "vision" section (lines ~498-509) to tie in the ratchet metaphor.

## current content

```markdown
# vision

build or use digital actors, who work even from your laptop, and work for anyone you choose.

distill your skills and roles iteratively, with rhachet. use them, compose them, share them, open source them. the choice is yours.

- with open source top to bottom, we can raise the floor and prosper collectively.
- with observable routes of thought, we can not only debug, but align.
- with composable thought routes, we can build incremental complexity and automate test coverage just like any code.

here's to a solarpunk future of abundance 🌞🌴

# vision

build or use digital actors, who work even from your laptop, and work for anyone you choose.

distill your skills and roles iteratively, with rhachet. use them, compose them, share them, open source them. the choice is yours.

rhachet is named after "ratchet" — a mechanism that allows movement in one direction only:

1. **capability ratchet**: slipless improvement of thought routes via externalized knowledge (briefs), incremented determinism (skills), and durable enrollment (actors). each improvement persists — swap of brains doesn't lose progress.

2. **purpose ratchet**: rhachet unlocks the [brains ratchet](.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/pol302.ratchets.knowledge.[article].md) — by make of brain enrollment open, composable, and shareable, it distributes the "brain that builds brains" capability.

with open source top to bottom:
- 🌊 we raise the floor and prosper collectively
- 🔭 we debug and align via observable thought routes
- 🪨 we compound complexity safely via composable thought

here's to a solarpunk future of abundance 🌞🌴

# test coverage requirements

this is a content/documentation project — the "domain logic" is the structure and content of briefs, not executable code. test coverage focuses on:

## structure validation (unit-like)

these tests validate brief structure without execute of external operations.

| test                | what it validates                                      | location                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| brief structure     | each brief has required sections (.what, .claims, etc) | `briefs/**/*.md` validation |
| claim format        | each claim has citation reference                      | inline validation           |
| reference integrity | all cited references exist                             | cross-file validation       |
| name convention     | files follow `{domain}{level}.{topic}.[type].md`       | glob pattern check          |

### implementation

```ts
// __test__/briefs/structure.test.ts
describe('brief structure validation', () => {
  given('[case1] postlabor briefs', () => {
    when('[t0] briefs are read', () => {
      then('each brief has .what section', async () => {
        const briefs = await glob('.agent/**/postlabor/*.md');
        for (const brief of briefs) {
          const content = await fs.readFile(brief, 'utf-8');
          expect(content).toContain('## .what');
        }
      });

      then('each brief has .claims section with citations', async () => {
        const briefs = await glob('.agent/**/postlabor/*.md');
        for (const brief of briefs) {
          const content = await fs.readFile(brief, 'utf-8');
          expect(content).toMatch(/## \.claims/);
          expect(content).toMatch(/\[ref\.\d+/);
        }
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## content validation (integration-like)

these tests validate content coherence across files.

| test                  | what it validates                            | scope               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| citation validity     | all citation numbers exist in reference file | briefs ↔ references |
| cross-reference links | all linked briefs exist                      | briefs ↔ briefs     |
| readme links          | all readme links resolve                     | readme ↔ briefs     |

### implementation

```ts
// __test__/briefs/references.integration.test.ts
describe('citation validity', () => {
  given('[case1] briefs with citations', () => {
    const references = useBeforeAll(async () => {
      const content = await fs.readFile(REFERENCES_FILE, 'utf-8');
      return parseCitations(content);
    });

    when('[t0] citations are extracted', () => {
      then('all cited references exist', async () => {
        const briefs = await glob('.agent/**/postlabor/*.md');
        for (const brief of briefs) {
          const content = await fs.readFile(brief, 'utf-8');
          const citations = extractCitations(content);
          for (const citation of citations) {
            expect(references.has(citation.refId, citation.number)).toEqual(true);
          }
        }
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## experience validation (acceptance-like)

these tests validate the blackbox criteria are met.

| usecase                 | test                                   | expected |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. dual ratchet         | readme contains ratchet explanation    | ✓        |
| 2. distribution matters | postlabor briefs exist and are linked  | ✓        |
| 3. three ratchets       | ratchet briefs exist                   | ✓        |
| 4. rhachet enables      | knowledge-ratchet-rhachet brief exists | ✓        |
| 5. distilled insights   | reference briefs with citations        | ✓        |
| 6. optimistic frame     | optimistic-frame brief exists          | ✓        |
| 7. readme scope         | vision section updated with links      | ✓        |

### implementation

```ts
// __test__/acceptance/usecases.acceptance.test.ts
describe('blackbox criteria', () => {
  given('[case1] usecase.1 - dual ratchet metaphor', () => {
    when('[t0] user reads readme', () => {
      then('finds ratchet explanation', async () => {
        const readme = await fs.readFile('readme.md', 'utf-8');
        expect(readme).toContain('capability ratchet');
        expect(readme).toContain('purpose ratchet');
      });

      then('finds link to philosophy brief', async () => {
        const readme = await fs.readFile('readme.md', 'utf-8');
        expect(readme).toContain('phi101.dual-ratchet-metaphor');
      });
    });
  });

  given('[case2] usecase.2 - why distribution matters', () => {
    when('[t0] user explores postlabor briefs', () => {
      then('finds extractors-vs-distributors brief', async () => {
        const exists = await fs.stat('.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/pol203.extractors-vs-distributors.[article].md').catch(() => null);
        expect(exists).not.toBeNull();
      });

      then('finds critical junctures brief', async () => {
        const exists = await fs.stat('.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/pol101.overview.[article].md').catch(() => null);
        expect(exists).not.toBeNull();
      });
    });
  });

  // ... additional usecases
});
```
