# deliverable.2 = readme update

## location

```
readme.md → "vision" section (lines ~498-509)
```

## current state

```md
# vision

build or use digital actors, who work even from your laptop, and work for anyone you choose.

distill your skills and roles iteratively, with rhachet. use them, compose them, share them, open source them. the choice is yours.

- with open source top to bottom, we can raise the floor and prosper collectively.
- with observable routes of thought, we can not only debug, but align.
- with composable thought routes, we can build incremental complexity and automate test coverage just like any code.

here's to a solarpunk future of abundance 🌞🌴
```

## target state

replace `# vision` with `# sophi` section:

```md
# sophi

### vision

digital actors that run from anywhere, for anyone.

distill portable, durable roles with rhachet. compose them, share them, open source them.

- open source top to bottom — the floor rises, prosperity spreads.
- observable thought routes — to not only debug, but align.
- composable thought routes — for iterative improvement and testable guarantees.

here's to a solarpunk future of distributed abundance 🌞🌴

### why "rhachet"?

the name reflects a dual ratchet metaphor:

1. to **ratchet iterative improvement** — slipless iterative improvement of capabilities via roles, briefs, and skills. each iteration builds on the last, externalized and durable.

2. to **ratchet distributed abundance** — rhachet unlocks the distribution of "brains that build brains". when anyone can enroll any brain to execute any skill, access to postlabor abundance spreads irreversibly.

for the philosophy behind this, see the [postlabor briefs](.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/).

# test coverage

## unit tests: brief structure compliance

### what

validate each brief follows the required template structure.

### how

```ts
// .behavior/.../tests/unit/briefStructure.test.ts

describe('postlabor briefs', () => {
  const briefs = glob('.agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor/*.md');

  briefs.forEach(brief => {
    it(`${brief} has required sections`, () => {
      const content = read(brief);
      expect(content).toContain('## .tldr');
      expect(content).toContain('## .what');
      expect(content).toContain('## .why');
    });

    it(`${brief} has citations when claims are made`, () => {
      const content = read(brief);
      if (content.includes('## .claims')) {
        expect(content).toMatch(/> \[\d+\]/); // numbered citation format
      }
    });
  });
});
```

## integration tests: cross-reference integrity

### what

validate links between briefs resolve and readme links work.

### how

```ts
// .behavior/.../tests/integration/crossReferences.test.ts

describe('cross-references', () => {
  it('readme links to postlabor briefs dir that exists', () => {
    const readme = read('readme.md');
    const linkMatch = readme.match(/\[postlabor briefs\]\(([^)]+)\)/);
    expect(linkMatch).toBeTruthy();
    expect(exists(linkMatch[1])).toBe(true);
  });

  it('soph001.overview links to all other briefs', () => {
    const overview = read('.agent/.../postlabor/soph001.overview.[article].md');
    const otherBriefs = glob('.agent/.../postlabor/soph*.md')
      .filter(b => !b.includes('soph001'));
    otherBriefs.forEach(brief => {
      const filename = basename(brief);
      expect(overview).toContain(filename);
    });
  });

  it('briefs reference research citations that exist', () => {
    const briefs = glob('.agent/.../postlabor/*.md');
    const research = read('.behavior/.../3.1.research.references._.v1.i1.md');
    briefs.forEach(brief => {
      const content = read(brief);
      const citations = content.match(/ref\.\d+/g) || [];
      citations.forEach(cite => {
        expect(research).toContain(`# ${cite}`);
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## acceptance tests: blackbox criteria satisfaction

### what

validate bdd scenarios from `2.criteria.blackbox.md` pass.

### how

human review checklist derived from criteria:

```md
# acceptance checklist

## usecase.1: dual ratchet metaphor
- [ ] readme explains dual ratchet metaphor
- [ ] first ratchet (thought routes) is clear
- [ ] second ratchet (distributors future) is clear
- [ ] readme links to briefs for deeper context

## usecase.2: why distribution matters
- [ ] brief explains extractors vs distributors
- [ ] brief explains postlabor as critical juncture
- [ ] brief includes historical critical juncture examples
- [ ] brief explains iron law of oligarchy risk

## usecase.3: three ratchet mechanisms
- [ ] brief explains brains ratchet
- [ ] brief explains brawns ratchet
- [ ] brief explains morals ratchet

## usecase.4: rhachet enables brains ratchet
- [ ] clear explanation of rhachet's role (enabler, not the brain itself)
- [ ] explains durable enrollment of any brain.atom to any skill
- [ ] explains how open source roles multiply capability

## usecase.5: distilled insights from sources
- [ ] key insights from "Why Nations Fail" present
- [ ] claims separated from commentary
- [ ] citations traceable to research references

## usecase.6: optimistic frame
- [ ] emphasizes hope, not fear
- [ ] acknowledges 99.999% alignment
- [ ] positions rhachet as "ensure" not "fight"

## usecase.7: readme update scope
- [ ] ratchet metaphor tied to solarpunk vision
- [ ] update is compact
- [ ] detailed philosophy linked, not inlined

## boundary cases
- [ ] philosophy section is skippable for practical users
- [ ] briefs contain logic, not emotional appeals
- [ ] rhachet synthesis is novel, not just summaries
```

# notes

## on rhachet's role

rhachet is **not** "the brain that builds brains".

rhachet **enables** the distribution of brain-build capability:
- durable enrollment of any brain.atom to execute any skill
- skills are externalized, shareable, composable
- anyone can create/share/compose actors

this distinction is critical. rhachet is the enabler, not the capability itself.

## on test coverage interpretation

since deliverables are primarily documentation:
- "unit tests" = structural validation (sections, format)
- "integration tests" = reference integrity (links, citations)
- "acceptance tests" = criteria satisfaction (human review)

automated tests verify structure; human review verifies sense.
