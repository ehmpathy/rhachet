# ref.1 = "Why Nations Fail" by Daron Acemoglu & James A. Robinson

**source**: Acemoglu, D. & Robinson, J.A. (2012). *Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty*. Crown Business.

**note**: authors won 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics for this work.

## 1.1 core thesis

> [1] "nations fail because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate."

> [2] "inclusive economic institutions that enforce property rights, create a level playing field, and encourage investments in new technologies and skills are more conducive to economic growth than extractive economic institutions that are structured to extract resources from the many by the few."

> [3] "inclusive economic institutions are in turn supported by, and support, inclusive political institutions, which distribute political power widely in a pluralistic manner and are able to achieve some amount of political centralization so as to establish law and order, the foundations of secure property rights, and an inclusive market economy."

## 1.2 extractive institutions

> [4] extractive institutions are "structured to extract resources from the many by the few"

> [5] extractive political institutions "cement the elite power base" and support extractive economic institutions

> [6] "extractive institutions trap [nations] in a vicious cycle. the cycle begins when an elite establishes political institutions to enrich themselves, by consolidating state power in their own hands without meaningful checks and balances."

## 1.3 inclusive institutions

> [7] inclusive institutions "distribute political power widely in a pluralistic manner"

> [8] inclusive institutions create "a level playing field" and "enforce property rights"

> [9] "virtuous cycles can help bend the long arc of history toward growth and prosperity"

## 1.4 critical junctures

> [10] "critical junctures are highly disruptive historical events that transform societies politically, socially, and economically. classic examples are the Black Death and the Industrial Revolution."

> [11] "a critical juncture is a double-edged sword that can cause a sharp turn in the trajectory of a nation. on the one hand it can open the way for breaking the cycle of extractive institutions and enable more inclusive ones to emerge, as in England. or it can intensify the emergence of extractive institutions, as was the case with the Second Serfdom in Eastern Europe."

> [12] "nations often diverge over time precisely because their institutions respond to the same critical junctures in different ways. while the Black Death tipped the balance of power toward the masses in England, it did the opposite in Eastern Europe."

## 1.5 critical juncture examples

### the Black Death (1346-1353)

> [13] "the Black Death spread across Europe in the 1300s, killing roughly half its population and fundamentally transforming its societies. before the plague, Europe was organized into an extractive and feudal system, in which kings granted their land to lords, who forced peasants to work on it."

> [14] the plague "multiplied existing institutional differences, leading to a major divergence" between Western and Eastern Europe

### the Glorious Revolution (1688)

> [15] "the Glorious Revolution was a brief conflict between the British monarchy and Parliament in 1688. Parliament was victorious—it replaced King James II and, more importantly, took over all real authority from the monarchy."

> [16] "the Glorious Revolution gave Parliament the power to set economic policy and allowed 'a broad cross section of society' to participate in politics for the first time. Parliament's economic reforms created strong property rights and a uniform tax code, which incentivized innovation."

> [17] Acemoglu and Robinson view the Glorious Revolution as "the turning point that built inclusive institutions in Britain and enabled the Industrial Revolution to take off there"

## 1.6 institutional drift

> [18] "just as two isolated populations of organisms will drift apart slowly in genetic drift, two otherwise similar societies will also slowly drift apart institutionally. the differences created by institutional drift become especially consequential because they influence how society reacts to changes during critical junctures."

> [19] "historical contingencies function similarly to random mutations in human evolution, creating what the authors term 'institutional drifts.' these drifts may persist, disappear, or expand through processes analogous to natural selection."

## 1.7 creative destruction

> [20] "sustained economic growth requires innovation, and innovation cannot be decoupled from creative destruction, which replaces the old with the new in the economic realm and also destabilizes established power relations in politics."

> [21] on China: "experiencing growth under extractive institutions — under the authoritarian grip of the Communist Party," but "it's not sustainable because it doesn't foster 'creative destruction' vital for innovation."

# ref.2 = "Iron Law of Oligarchy" by Robert Michels

**source**: Michels, R. (1911). *Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy* (original: *Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie*).

## 2.1 core thesis

> [22] "the iron law of oligarchy" asserts that "rule by an elite, or oligarchy, is inevitable as an 'iron law' within any democratic organization as part of the 'tactical and technical necessities' of the organization."

> [23] "all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies."

## 2.2 key quotes from Michels

> [24] "every system of leadership is incompatible with the most essential postulates of democracy … the principle cause of oligarchy in the democratic parties is to be found in the technical indispensability of leadership … it is organizations which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the delegators. who says organization, says oligarchy."

> [25] "democracy is inconceivable without organization. … organization, based as it is upon the principle of least effort, that is to say, upon the greatest possible economy of energy, is the weapon of the weak in their struggle with the strong."

> [26] "thus the leaders, who were at first no more than the executive organs of the collective will, soon emancipate themselves from the masses and become independent of its control. organization implies a tendency to oligarchy. in every organization, whether it be a political party, a professional union, or any other association of the kind, the aristocratic tendency manifests itself very clearly. … as a result of organization, every party or professional union becomes divided into a minority of directors and a majority of directed. with the advance of organization, democracy tends to decline."

> [27] "the apathy of the masses and their need for guidance has as its counterpart in the leaders a natural greed for power. thus the development of the democratic oligarchy is accelerated by the general characteristics of human nature. what was initiated by the need for organization, administration, and strategy is completed by psychological determinism."

> [28] "historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."

## 2.3 mechanisms

> [29] "organizational oligarchy resulted, most fundamentally, from the imperatives of modern organization: competent leadership, centralized authority, and the division of tasks within a professional bureaucracy."

> [30] Michels argued it wasn't a forced takeover but often a "consensual surrender." he spoke of "the gratitude of the masses"—our psychological desire to let others handle the exhausting burden of self-governance.

## 2.4 counterexamples and critiques

> [31] "scholars note counterexamples of long-standing democratic organizations and highlight mechanisms – such as rotating leadership, participatory governance, checks and balances, and collective decision-making – that can resist oligarchization."

> [32] "one of the best known exceptions to the iron law of oligarchy is the now defunct International Typographical Union, described by Seymour Martin Lipset in his 1956 book, *Union Democracy*."

# ref.3 = "Technofeudalism" by Yanis Varoufakis

**source**: Varoufakis, Y. (2023). *Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism*. Melville House.

## 3.1 core thesis

> [33] "capitalism is now dead, in the sense that its dynamics no longer govern our economies. in that role it has been replaced by something fundamentally different, which he calls technofeudalism."

> [34] "this is how capitalism ends: not with a revolutionary bang, but with an evolutionary whimper. just as it displaced feudalism gradually, surreptitiously, until one day the bulk of human relations were market-based and feudalism was swept away, so capitalism today is being toppled by a new economic mode: techno-feudalism."

## 3.2 mechanism

> [35] "big tech has replaced capitalism's twin pillars—markets and profit—with its platforms and rents. with every click and scroll, we labor like serfs to increase its power."

> [36] "the power of techno-feudalists arises when they extract human data to shape our preferences, as in the case of Alexa that collects our data, turns us into unpaid cloud serfs, and enriches the algorithm owners."

> [37] "the cloud has created a feedback loop that removes our agency. we train the algorithm to find what we like and then the algorithm trains us to like what it offers."

## 3.3 origins

> [38] "the seeds for technofeudalism were conceived in the 2008 financial crisis. central banks opened floodgates of state money to capitalists, but much of this money was diverted into asset purchases and share buybacks. crucially, a significant portion of this cheap money fuelled the rise of Big Tech, enabling corporations like Amazon and Tesla to pay for server farms, fibre optic cables, AI research, and software developers."

## 3.4 proposed solutions

> [39] Varoufakis "argues for replacing the market for shares with employee ownership of companies. he adds that a one employee one share system would democratise the workplace."

> [40] "on cloud serfs, he argues that consumer data should be bought from consenting users instead of being freely extracted."

# ref.4 = Ratchet Effect in Economics

**source**: Peacock, A.T. & Wiseman, J. (1961). *The Growth of Public Expenditure in the United Kingdom*. Princeton University Press.

## 4.1 definition

> [41] "the ratchet effect is a concept in sociology and economics illustrating the difficulty with reversing a course of action once a specific thing has occurred, analogous with the mechanical ratchet that allows movement in one direction and seizes or tightens in the opposite."

## 4.2 government and policy application

> [42] "the ratchet effect is a theory of government growth. during a crisis, both the magnitude (or 'scale') and the range (or 'scope') of government activities grow, relative to before the crisis. after the crisis subsides, some government policies and activities recede, but the overall size of government does not return to its pre-crisis size."

> [43] "the displacement effect explains why the (horizontal) trend line moves upward in discrete steps over time, whereas the ratchet effect affirms that public expenditure 'ratchets' during drops in the economy and remains at a higher level after the economy stabilizes."

## 4.3 welfare state application

> [44] "welfare states inevitably face pressure from various social groups and bureaucrats to expand benefits, as welfare expansion strengthens political power and bureaucratic influence. this dynamic leads to the 'ratchet effect,' where welfare spending continually increases but cannot be reduced without significant political backlash."

> [45] "when a government introduces a new public service or social welfare program, it creates a certain level of expectation among the beneficiaries. even if the economic conditions change and funding becomes scarce, reducing or eliminating such programs can meet with significant public outrage, making it politically and socially difficult for the government to revert to previous spending levels."

## 4.4 irreversibility

> [46] "emergency measures can become entrenched through the ratchet effect, as the ongoing fear of terrorism fossilizes exceptions to civil liberties into standard practice long after the initial crisis has passed."

> [47] "similar patterns can be observed with social welfare programs, where transitioning back from extensive coverage becomes challenging due to public backlash and dependency."

# ref.5 = Post-Scarcity Economics

**sources**: various academic and analytical sources on post-scarcity theory

## 5.1 definition

> [48] "a post-scarcity society is a hypothetical economic model in which the production and distribution of goods and services are so efficient and plentiful that the basic needs and wants of every individual are met without the need for labor or financial exchange."

> [49] "this type of society is characterized by widespread availability of resources, minimal or non-existent poverty, reduced income inequality, and a shift from an economy driven by scarcity to one based on abundance."

## 5.2 role of automation

> [50] "advancements in technology, particularly automation and artificial intelligence (AI), play a crucial role in achieving this level of abundance. these technologies enable the efficient production and distribution of goods and services, significantly reducing the need for human labor."

> [51] "one perspective argues that what's actually stopping us from being post-scarcity is not lack of resources, but the forced reliance on human labour."

## 5.3 universal basic income/services

> [52] "a post-scarcity society could potentially address income inequality through the implementation of policies such as universal basic income (UBI). by providing a guaranteed income for every citizen, UBI could alleviate poverty, reduce income disparities, and provide a safety net for individuals affected by job displacement due to automation and AI."

> [53] "UBI does not guarantee by default protection against inflation, therefore prices for basic needs may become unsustainable. a more direct policy is therefore needed to guarantee the basic needs first, which are easier to predict since they are universal, and then to give a UBI on top."

## 5.4 basic needs defined

> [54] "basic needs are defined mainly based on biological needs: food, water, energy, healthcare, education, housing, transportation, and a clean and safe environment to live in. given the importance of the internet, some also consider basic access to telecommunications and the internet."

## 5.5 timeline estimates

> [55] "on a long-term horizon, assuming sustained advancement in artificial intelligence, the main obstacle appears to be ideological, not technological."

> [56] "some analysts suggest we are only 20-30 years away from post-scarcity from a purely tech perspective. however, overall estimates suggest about 60-70 years, mainly due to generational change and the need for infrastructure changes."

## 5.6 governance challenge

> [57] "unless capitalism is managed by an ethically responsible state, we are most likely to experience a dystopian variant of highly automated capitalism."

# ref.6 = Solarpunk Movement

**sources**: various cultural and academic sources on solarpunk

## 6.1 definition

> [58] "solarpunk is a literary, artistic, and social movement, closely related to the hopepunk movement, that envisions and works toward actualizing a sustainable future interconnected with nature and community."

> [59] "the 'solar' represents solar energy as a renewable energy source and an optimistic vision of the future that rejects climate doomerism, while the 'punk' refers to do it yourself and the countercultural, post-capitalist, and sometimes decolonial aspects of creating such a future."

## 6.2 core philosophy

> [60] "at the heart of Solarpunk is a simple idea: that technology can enhance our connection with nature, rather than destroying it."

> [61] "in this vision of a solarpunk future, technology serves as a means to an end, not an end in itself. it becomes a tool through which we pursue a new North Star: the sustenance and well-being of our ecosystems."

## 6.3 aesthetic and themes

> [62] "in contrast to cyberpunk, which is portrayed as having a dark, grim aesthetic, solarpunk is bright, with light often used as a motif and in imagery to convey feelings of cleanliness, abundance, and equability."

> [63] "there are three elements in the growing body of solarpunk literature that have come to characterize the genre: light, abundance, and transparency."

## 6.4 technology and society

> [64] "unlike cyberpunks who imagine the world being dominated by evil corporations, solarpunks imagine a society where people and the planet are prioritized over the individual and profit. essentially, say goodbye to conglomerates, hierarchies and excessive wealth, and hello to decentralised and open-source technologies, shared knowledge, as well as community building and cooperation."

> [65] "although solarpunk is concerned with technology, it also embraces low-tech ways of living sustainably such as gardening, permaculture, regenerative design, tool libraries, maker spaces, open-source, and do-it-yourself ethics."

## 6.5 solarpunk manifesto

> [66] "the Solarpunk Manifesto calls for 'solutions to live comfortably without fossil fuels, to equitably manage scarcity and share abundance, to be kinder to each other and to the planet we share.'"

## 6.6 social justice

> [67] "at its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a world that is not only sustainable but also fair and equitable—a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their race, gender, class, or any other social or economic factor. solarpunk recognizes that the climate crisis is a social justice issue."

# ref.7 = Open Source AI & Democratization

**sources**: various technology and policy sources

## 7.1 the rise of open source AI

> [68] "2023 has seen an unprecedented renaissance in the open-source AI community, with projects like Llama 2 and Stable Diffusion challenging the dominance of closed-source solutions."

> [69] "it's not just about sharing code; it's about democratizing the future of the very technologies."

## 7.2 major open source models

> [70] "in July 2022, the Big Science consortium released BLOOM, a fully open, large language model comparable to GPT-3. BLOOM has open-source code, transparent training datasets, and a collaborative production model that involved over 1,000 researchers."

> [71] "in the same month, Stability.AI released Stable Diffusion, a fully open text-to-image model that could produce images similar to those generated by proprietary models such as Midjourney or Dall-E."

> [72] "Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in the democratization of artificial intelligence. developed by Meta, Llama models have fundamentally changed the landscape of AI accessibility by providing state-of-the-art language models that are freely available for research and commercial use."

## 7.3 democratization impact

> [73] "making AI tools, technology, and expertise available to a wider range of individuals and organizations — particularly those that have previously lacked the financial means or technical know-how — is known as 'democratizing AI.'"

> [74] "open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools, democratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. the decentralization of AI expertise does more than simply distribute knowledge — it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress in the industry."

## 7.4 distributed AI

> [75] "these examples of open-source models signal the possibility of democratizing and decentralizing AI development. they demonstrate that a different trajectory is possible than that of centralization through proprietary solutions."

> [76] "techniques like federated learning and decentralized AI will allow open source models to be trained and deployed in a privacy-preserving manner, addressing data sovereignty and security concerns."

# ref.8 = Von Neumann Self-Replicating Machines

**source**: von Neumann, J. (1966). *Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata*. University of Illinois Press. (edited and completed by Arthur W. Burks from lectures delivered 1948-1949)

## 8.1 original concept

> [77] "a detailed conceptual proposal for a self-replicating machine was first put forward by mathematician John von Neumann in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a kinematic model of self-reproducing automata as a thought experiment."

> [78] "von Neumann's goal was to design a machine whose complexity could grow automatically akin to biological organisms under natural selection."

> [79] "in his design, the self-replicating machine consists of three parts: a 'description' of itself, a universal constructor mechanism that can read any description and construct the machine encoded in that description, and a universal copy machine that can make copies of any description."

## 8.2 exponential growth

> [80] "von Neumann argued that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth."

> [81] "given enough construction materials, such a robot could multiply exponentially — one robot copies itself into another robot, two robots become four, four robots become eight, and so on."

> [82] "imagine an unmanned space probe that could explore the galaxy while also harvesting raw materials from passing asteroids and planets to build copies of itself. we would only need a few dozen generations of these probes before we could assign a single probe to each of the 250 billion stars in the Milky Way."

## 8.3 NASA research

> [83] "in 1980, NASA conducted a joint summer study with ASEE entitled 'Advanced Automation for Space Missions' to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop lunar resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site. the proposed system would have been capable of exponentially increasing productive capacity."

## 8.4 current feasibility

> [84] "through a technology analysis, it was concluded that the current maturity of artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, and asteroid resource harvesting technologies hinder the development of a completely self-replicating probe. however, partially self-replicating probes are feasible."
