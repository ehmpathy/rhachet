review this blueprint draft on a zoomin that adresses a few gaps from the original execution
- .behavior/v2026_02_05.keyrack/7.3.blueprint.v1.i1.md

against how well it will satisfy the specifically discussed scope as it relates to this wish
- in .behavior/v2026_02_05.keyrack/0.wish.md

follow the patterns already present in this repo

and write a new blueprint that leverages the decisions made in the one above, refines them, and makes them more cohesive and coherent

---

enforce thorough test coverage for proof of behavior satisfaction
- unit tests for all domain logic
- integration tests for all repo <-> access boundaries (os, apis, sdks, daos, etc)
- integration tests for all end <-> end flows
- acceptance tests for core blackbox behaviors

---

include a treestruct of filediffs

**legend:**
- `[+] create` — file to create
- `[~] update` — file to update
- `[-] delete` — file to delete


---

include a treestruct of codepaths

**legend:**
- `[+]` create — codepath to create
- `[~]` update — codepath to update
- `[○]` retain — codepath to retain
- `[-]` delete — codepath to delete
- `[←]` reuse — codepath to reuse from elsewhere
- `[→]` eject — codepath to decompose for reuse


---

remember, the purpose of the blueprint is to declare what the execution will adhere to

we want to see
- what contracts will be used
- how domain.objects and domain.operations are decomposed and recomposed
- what the codepaths are, their ease of maintenance and readability
