## detailed findings

### keychain — ⛔ avoid

**owner**: Apple Inc.

**registrations**:
- **Keychain®** — trademark, generic term: "os feature"
- **iCloud Keychain®** — service mark, generic term: "online service"

**source**: [Apple Trademark List](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html)

**registered**: iCloud Keychain registered October 15, 2014 (certificates 4,619,972 and 4,619,973)

**risk**: high — same domain (credential/password management), strong brand association

**recommendation**: avoid — direct conflict with Apple's trademark in the same product category

---

### keyvault / key vault — ⚠️ avoid

**owner**: Microsoft (product name)

**product**: Azure Key Vault — Microsoft's cloud secrets management service

**trademark status**: "Azure" is registered (registration #6110585, 2020-07-28). "Key Vault" is a product name under the Azure brand.

**source**: [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/), [Azure trademark](https://trademarks.justia.com/882/96/azure-88296304.html)

**additional conflict**: the rhachet vision already uses "vault" for storage backends (os.direct, os.secure, 1password) — to name the system "keyvault" creates internal namespace collision

**risk**: high — strong product association, internal architecture conflict

**recommendation**: avoid — both trademark proximity and internal collision

---

### vault — ⚠️ caution

**owner**: HashiCorp (attempted)

**trademark status**: HashiCorp filed for "VAULT" trademark but it was **refused/dismissed/invalidated** by USPTO

**source**: [USPTO report](https://uspto.report/TM/87832336)

**enforcement**: despite failed registration, HashiCorp states in their [trademark policy](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/trademark-policy): "you may not apply a trademark to derivative works that is similar (in sight, sound or sense) to 'Vault'"

**risk**: medium — no registered trademark, but enforced via policy

**recommendation**: usable for internal concepts (storage backend), but avoid as primary product name

---

### keybank — ⛔ avoid

**owner**: KeyCorp / KeyBank National Association

**what it is**: 27th largest bank in the United States, ~1000 branches, $187 billion in assets

**registrations**:
- KeyBank®
- Key®
- KeyCorp®

**source**: [KeyBank Registered Trademarks](https://www.key.com/about/media/key-bank-registered-trademarks.html)

**risk**: high — major financial institution, completely different industry but strong brand

**recommendation**: avoid — trademark infringement risk, association with bank

---

### keyring — ✅ safe

**trademark status**: no known registration for software/credential management

**prior art**:
- GNOME Keyring (open source, linux)
- Python `keyring` library (open source)
- Generic term for physical key holder

**blue collar usage**: "janitor ring", "key ring" — established trade terminology

**regional note**: preferred term in British English (vs American "keychain")

**source**: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain), [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring)

**risk**: low — generic term with open source precedent

**recommendation**: safe to use — strong candidate

---

### keyrack — ✅ likely safe

**trademark status**: no known registration in software/credential domain

**usage**: hotel front desk terminology — the board with slots where room keys/keycards hang

**metaphor fit**: aligns with vision's "keycard" output metaphor — credentials go in, keycards come out, keycards hang on the rack

**source**: [hotel front office equipment](https://hmhub.in/1st-sem-front-office-notes/front-office-equipments/)

**risk**: low — no apparent conflicts

**recommendation**: likely safe — strong candidate that aligns with keycard metaphor

---

### keybelt — ✅ likely safe

**trademark status**: no known registration found

**usage**: not an established term — would be a novel coinage

**related products**: "belt key holder", "key reel", "retractable key chain" are used by janitors/facilities workers, but "keybelt" as a single word is not standard

**source**: no trademark found in searches

**risk**: low — novel term, no apparent conflicts

**recommendation**: likely safe, but trades recognition for uniqueness

---

### keys — ✅ safe

**trademark status**: generic term, not trademarkable alone

**risk**: low — too generic to trademark in isolation

**consideration**: may be overloaded in software contexts (ssh keys, api keys, encryption keys, etc.)

**recommendation**: safe but potentially ambiguous

---

### keyset — ✅ likely safe

**trademark status**: no known registration in software/credential domain

**usage**: locksmith terminology for organized key collections

**risk**: low

**recommendation**: likely safe

---

### keybunch — ✅ likely safe

**trademark status**: no known registration

**usage**: informal collective noun ("a bunch of keys")

**risk**: low

**recommendation**: likely safe, but informal tone

---

## methodology

1. web searches for "[term] trademark" and "[term] USPTO registered"
2. checked apple trademark list directly
3. checked microsoft/hashicorp product names
4. searched for major financial/tech companies with similar names

**note**: this is preliminary research, not legal advice. a formal trademark search via USPTO TESS database and/or legal counsel is recommended before final decisions.

---

## recommendation

**top candidates** (clear of trademark issues):

1. **keyring** — established term, linux precedent, blue collar roots, no trademark conflicts
2. **keyrack** — hotel front desk metaphor, aligns with vision's "keycard" output
3. **keys** — radically simple, generic (untrademarkable), but potentially overloaded

**avoid**:
- keychain (Apple®)
- keyvault (Microsoft Azure)
- keybank (KeyBank®)
