postlabor asymptotes
- post-operator
- post-strategist
- post-curator

---

postlabor conceptually has 3 fundamental phases
1. post-operator
2. post-strategist
3. post-curator

---

post-operator =

  when robots are able to execute any declared strategy & fulfill it reliably

  i.e., w/ rhachet + khlone, we achieve post-operator

  skills are strategically distilled so that khlones can operate them and fulfill any objective

  depends on
  - delegation
  - orchestration

---

post-strategy

  this is where robots are delegated to the ability to strategize

  at this point, we become locked in an arms race

  businesses are now structurally unstable as any moat can be destabalized strategically with enough time. && beter strategies = new mechanisms for success

  ---

  distillation of skills for how to strategize better

  &&

  execution of strategy exploration

  becomes a red queen arms race


  ---

  asymptotic becuase it will likely never end (as skills related to strategization continuously selectively evolve under competitive and intrinsic pressures)

  the timestcale that this occurs over may be forever, too

  &&

  the strength of a moat will be measured in terms of
  - strategic compute spent in vulnerability detection (which is constrained by cost.{time,cash} * efficiency of strategy skills)
  - the resource cost required to exploit detected vulnerabilities

  ---

  i.e.,

  - moats are measureable
  - skills are evolved, red queen arms race
  - systemic stability is searched for
  - systemic opportunities are searched for

  ---

  true post-strategy is the asymptotic stable state where all moats have been disolved w/ sufficient strategy

  in a world w/ no more moats, then
  - execution is commoditized
  - efficiency is commoditized
  - capacity is commoditized

  no captured resources exist.

  instead, totally distributed abundance is all that remains
  - free outcome of anything desired
    - cash cost goes to zero (literally)
    - time cost goes to zero (symbolically; really, to the theoretical limit for any operation that achieves the same behavior)

  ---

  in that world, only curation remains
  - taste; gut feel on whats better or whats worse
  - values; what kind of world do you want to live in?
  - purpose; why do you care?
  - etc

  ---

  at the end of the post-strategy curve, @ the asymptote,

  curation becomes the last frontier of human labor.

  i.e.,
  - why to strategize?
  - what to strategize for?

  consumers will vote w/ dollars based on values

  what values they want to express

  what systemic outcomes the businesses they purchase from produce

  what virtues they represent

  they'll vote for the ffuture via their purchases; their patronage.

  via what they choose to spend their time on.

  ---

  khue's come in on
  - what about post-curator?
  - wouldn't post-curator arrive in parallel to post-strategist?

  ---

  also, a question is,

  khue; post-operator, would folks even have the ability to purchase?
  - assumptino is yes
  - in the distributed postlabor abundance future, anyone can have anything
  - the only cost is time && sustainability

  ---

  the floor is raised
  the ceiling is unbound
  the walls are firm (treat others as self)

---

post-curator

  the last asymptote is post-curator

  && again, asymptote because its unclear if ever humans will be totally removed or whether there will always be an advantage of added human perspective; peer review

  ---

  w/ curation in particular,

  for human tastes

  1. values are curatable
  2. vibes are curatable
  3. priorities are curatable

  ---

  the role of a human may be to curate their bet && see if it resonates w/ otehrs

  ---

  similar to all labor though, its possible even curation

  can be distilled into skills that surpass human capacity or efficiency each time too

  hence, some long run asymptote

  bet = this will take longer than post-strategy

---
---
---

1; post-operator asymptote =

  robo ability to delegate and orchestrate execution against prescribed (= distilled skill) strategies

2; post-strategist asymptote =

  robo ability to strategize the best way to fulfill any objective

3; post-curator asymptote =

  robo ability to curate the most desirable taste in future (design, values, priorities, etc)

---

the impact of each is restabilization

1. post-operator = restabalization of employment & survival
2. post-strategist = restabilization of business & ecosystems
3. post-curator = restablization of independence


---

specifically

---

post-operator;

  humans are no longer competitive as operators

  theres no more room for hand woven fabrics

  when you have the loom.

  this means employment and surival contracts must have sever restabilization

  this impacts 90%+ of all folks.

---

post-strategist;

  humans are no longer competitive as strategists

  theres no more room for human ideas to compete in how to achieve goals, efficiency, or capacity

  its all driven by increasingly comodetized strategic capability, until everything is commoditized

---

post-curator ;

  humans are no longer competitive as curators

  post strategist, everything is commoditized

  purchase from bizX
  costs the same as
  purchase from bizY

  so, by the end of post-strategist, the only differentiator = taste

  = the curated "taste" of the product
  - how does it make you feel
  - what does it represent
  - what values does it propogate
  - what future does it systemically produce

---

at that point, curated taste is the last frontier

- why to do things
- what to strategize for
- &&
- in what priority? (prioritized against time)

---

eventually, & robably longer than it takes to achieve post-strategy

we'll reach post-curation

where even this, it is no longer competitive for humans to curate

as a robot will always be skilled enough to produce better taste

at that point, we cant even trust our gut

a total loss of independence -> we choose all, but never produce any


---

now, on curation

the universe is so immensely infinite

that perhaps there will always be room for humans

to independently express and explore tastes in different realms

so perhaps we'll always be navigators of our own destiny

&&

always have the questions to explore through

---

but!

the answer space

that will be post-labor

robots will propell to the navigable spaces much faster than us

&&

synthesisze the deliverables faster too


---

so, post-curation

our only frontier will be
- to explore (concepts, space, diversity of imagined tastes, etc)
- to express (life, emote, experience, etc)

---

maybe as enriched companions to robots with unlimited freedoms

but surely companions at best, and not the producers any longer

e.g., spoiled and constrained only by walls that keep eachother unharmed by eachother
