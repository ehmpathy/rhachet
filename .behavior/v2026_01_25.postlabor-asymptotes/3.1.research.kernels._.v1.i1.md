# research: kernel extraction from wish and seed

## .summary

this document extracts and classifies all claims from the wish (0.wish.md) and its seed reference (.ref/seed.md) into four categories:

- **[FACT]** = indisputable, immutable truth (true by definition, logical necessity, or physical law)
- **[SUMP]** = assumption, explicit or implicit, that may or may not hold
- **[KHUE]** = open question that should be explored
- **[OPIN]** = opinion or subjective declaration

---

## .classification legend

| label | meaning | treatment |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| [FACT] | invariant truth | keep as axiom |
| [SUMP] | assumption | examine, prove, or mark as contingent |
| [KHUE] | open question | explore, answer, or acknowledge as unknown |
| [OPIN] | opinion | acknowledge as perspective, not claim as truth |

## .kernels from wish (0.wish.md)

### definitional claims

**[1]** wish:28-30
> "these are questions & explorations that are forced by the rapid evolution of robot brains and their involvement in everyday life"

- **[SUMP]** rapid evolution of robot brains forces these questions
- **[SUMP]** we are rapidly approaching post-labor asymptotes
- **[SUMP]** we approach asymptotes "simultaneously" across dimensions

---

**[2]** wish:31-34

> "that way, we can know where to prioritize our labor, while it is still relevant - and how long which kinds of labor may be relevant for"

- **[OPIN]** prudence of awareness of stable states
- **[SUMP]** stable states exist and can be predicted
- **[SUMP]** some kinds of labor will become irrelevant

---

**[3]** wish:38

- **[OPIN]** hope for ratchet choices
- **[SUMP]** better stable states exist and can be chosen
- **[SUMP]** ratchet mechanisms can lock in better states

---

### outcome claims

**[4]** wish:43-47
> "the overall objective is that at the end of it all"
> "- the floors are raised; all is accessible to all, all effect to all people"
> "- the ceils are unbound; all wishes are feasible; explorable or fulfillable. only question is cost.time"

- **[OPIN]** floors raised = desirable objective
- **[SUMP]** all will be accessible to all
- **[SUMP]** all wishes will be feasible (only time-constrained)
- **[OPIN]** walls enforced = desirable (agency protection)

---

**[5]** wish:52-55
> "the singular constraint that remains at the end of it all is"
> "- time"
> "time is the only constraint that will never be eliminated; time limit, too, of heatdeath"

- **[FACT]** time cannot be eliminated as a constraint (physical law — causality, entropy)
- **[FACT]** heat death imposes ultimate time limit (thermodynamics)
- **[SUMP]** time will be the *only* constraint (other constraints eliminated)

---

**[6]** wish:57-59

### asymptote definitions

**[9]** wish:81-85
> "in effect, postlabor eliminates the human competitiveness for each of these"
> "- post-operator -> hands; human.hands are no longer competitive"
> "- post-strategist -> brains; human.brains are no longer competitive"
> "- post-curator -> guts; human.guts are no longer competitive"

- **[FACT]** if robots do X better, humans are not competitive at X (tautological)
- **[SUMP]** post-operator will make human hands non-competitive
- **[SUMP]** post-strategist will make human brains non-competitive

> "- vary in duration in how long it takes to acheive replacement"
> "- post-replacement of human, will in some cases always have an arms race of constant evolutionary competitive pressure to continue to evolve in capability. (up to what limit?)"
> "especially post strategy, for competivie businesses, unless they union like lightbulb manufacturerers, but that itself would be unstable due to hte ease of entries for incumbants, so yes, no moat is safe -> red queen arms race forever for strategy"

- **[SUMP]** progression varies by subdomain
- **[SUMP]** progression varies in duration
- **[SUMP]** post-replacement arms race will occur in some cases
- **[KHUE]** "up to what limit?" — the arms race limit is unknown

### human involvement stages

**[12]** wish:108-115
> "but we should make it clear on each dimension"
> "where"
> "1. humans are isolated (no robots available)"
> "2. humans are extended by robots (humans start leverage of robots via delegation of subskills while in controll of entrypoint skills)"
> "3. humans are competed by robots (even with robot extensions for humans, robots on their own are now competitive, as there is no skill left in the domain that the robot cant do)"
> "4. humans are surpassed by robots (robots now regularly surpass human performance, unassisted; these skills of robots, however, were still distilled via human in the loop)"
> "5. robots are competed by robots (robots are now in a red queen arms race with eachother, where even their own skills are produced by robots; humans are not competitive at all)"

- **[FACT]** stage 1 definition: isolated = no robots available (definitional)
- **[FACT]** stage 2 definition: extended = delegation while human controls entry (definitional)

- **[FACT]** stage 4 definition: surpassed = robots exceed human unassisted (definitional)
- **[FACT]** stage 5 definition: red-queen = robots compete with robots (definitional)

---

**[13]** wish:120-128
> "for example"
> "1. humans are isolated = classic software developer"
> "2. humans are extended by robots = leverage rhachet roles to produce software (robots write, blueprint, etc), but humans still drive the process and closely review."
> "3. humans are competed by robots = leverage khlone delegates to produce software (robots do everything, e.g., foreman drives architect,mechanic,reviewer to coordinate and verify sucessful delivery)"
> "4. humans are surpassed by robots = dependent on khlone delegates to produce software (human labor in software production is non-competitive; all software is done primarily via khlones)"
> "5. robots are competed by robots = khlone delegates tune the rhachet roles that other khlone delegates produce software with; its an arms race of who will produce better software faster via ratchet effects on roles leveraged by khlones to build more efficient & more effective khlones"

- **[OPIN]** software development as demonstration domain
- **[SUMP]** this progression will occur in software development

### epistemic claims

**[14]** wish:146-154
> "note: one important thing to make clear is that"

> "i.e., this is the inevitable future that robot brains produce"

- **[SUMP]** postlabor is inevitable (claimed as fact, but unproven)
- **[OPIN]** exploration based on systemic fundamentals

---

**[15]** wish:158-164
> "a next question is, how do humans fit in and achieve fulfillemnt in life within this future?"
> "but before we digress into that, we want to first formalize what the future will inevitably look like."
> "we want to clearly mark all 'assumptions' and ideally eliminate them, as nothing in this distillation should be 'assumed' or variable"
> "the whole distillation should be based entirely on invariants that are true-by-definition"

- **[KHUE]** how do humans achieve fulfillment in this future?
- **[OPIN]** desire to eliminate assumptions
- **[OPIN]** distillation should be based on invariants

---

**[16]** wish:166-170
> "e.g.,"
> "- given: robots do the same work better and faster than humans"
> "- then: human labor is not competitive and will not be employable at scale"
> "that's a fundamental truth; devoid of any opinion"

- **[FACT]** if robots do same work better+faster → human labor not competitive (logical implication)
- **[SUMP]** the "given" (robots do same work better+faster) is assumed to be true

## .observations

### facts are primarily definitional

most [FACT] claims are definitional (what "post-operator" means) or logical implications (if A then B). the core physical facts are:
- time cannot be eliminated (causality)
- heat death imposes ultimate limit (thermodynamics)
- universe is immensely large (cosmology)
- if robots do X better, humans not competitive at X (tautology)

### assumptions are the load-bear structure

the framework rests heavily on assumptions about:
- robot capability trajectories (will achieve X)
- economic outcomes (costs go to zero, moats dissolve)
- social outcomes (distributed abundance, restabilization)
- timeline claims (post-curator takes longer than post-strategist)

### key open questions

the seed explicitly surfaces questions that should be explored:
- will humans always have a role in curation?
- does post-curator arrive in parallel to post-strategist?
- what is the limit of the arms race?
- will folks have ability to purchase post-operator?

### opinions frame the narrative

opinions shape the desirability frame:
- "floors raised, ceilings unbound, walls firm" as goals
- "enriched companions" vs "spoiled" frames
- "spread life and understand universe" as objective

## .next steps

per the wish's prescribed rigid skill sequence:

1. ✅ kernelize — claims extracted and classified above
2. → cluster citations and identify interdependencies
3. → construct treestruct of progressive disclosure
4. → propose breakdown of briefs
5. → execute and write briefs

the next step should cluster these kernels into conceptual groups and identify which assumptions need validation vs which can be taken as contingent premises.
