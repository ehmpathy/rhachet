# research: templates for postlabor asymptotes briefs

## .summary

this document researches the template patterns from `rhachet-roles-bhrain/thinker/briefs/knowledge` to inform the structure of postlabor asymptotes briefs as requested in the wish.

---

## .template structure overview

the template repository contains 44 files organized into a progressive disclosure system [1]:

| prefix | topic | count |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `kno101.*` | primitives (ontology, relationships, instances, documents, concepts) | 5 |
| `kno201.*` | document archetypes (articles, catalogs, demos, lessons) | 5 |
| `kno301.*` | document compression & enbriefing (refs, kernels, briefs) | 21 |
| `kno351.*` | recursion & meta-documentation | 2 |
| `kno401.*` | actors (author, librarian, interdependence) | 3 |
| `kno501.*` | catalog structure templates | 2 |

this numbering follows a collegial progression pattern:
- `1xx` = foundational primitives
- `2xx` = document types
- `3xx` = compression & transformation mechanisms
- `4xx` = actor roles
- `5xx` = synthesis & templates

## .key patterns

### pattern 1: the concept-instance-document triad

**source**: `kno101.primitives.1.ontology.[article].frame.docs_as_materializations.md` [2]

> "knowledge rests on three interdependent layers:
> - **instances** (atoms of data/experience)
> - **documents** (materializations built on instances)
> - **concepts** (patterns/relationships in reality)"

> "documents sit in the middle layer: they **leverage instances to reveal concepts**"

> "concepts (patterns in reality)
>     ↓ materialized via
> documents (organized arrangements of instances)
>     ↓ grounded in
> instances (atoms of raw data/experience)"

**relation to wish**: the postlabor asymptotes are **concepts** (patterns in reality). the seed.md contains **instances** (observations, examples, progression sequences). the briefs will be **documents** that materialize these concepts by organization of the instances.

---

### pattern 2: document archetypes

**source**: `kno201.documents._.[catalog].md` [3]

> "| **archetype** | **what** |
> |---------------|----------|
> | 📖 **article**   | defines *what a concept is* |
> | 🗂️ **catalog**   | organizes *how concepts/instances relate* |
> | 🎬 **demo**      | exemplifies *how an instance shows a concept* |
> | 🎓 **lesson**    | teaches *how a concept is learned/practiced* |"

> "- 📖 **articles define**
> - 🗂️ **catalogs organize**
> - 🎬 **demos exemplify**
> - 🎓 **lessons teach**
>
> each archetype materializes concepts from instances with a distinct treatment style, together forming a complementary system of knowledge."

**relation to wish**: the postlabor asymptotes briefs should use multiple archetypes:
- `[article]` for definitional briefs (e.g., "what is post-operator?")
- `[catalog]` for organizational briefs (e.g., "human involvement stages across asymptotes")
- `[demo]` for relational briefs (e.g., "software development as post-operator example")
- `[lesson]` for pedagogical briefs (e.g., "how to evaluate labor competitiveness")

---

### pattern 3: compression axis

**source**: `kno301.doc.compression._.[article].md` [4]

> "| variant           | purpose | compression  | concept span   | role |
> |-------------------|---------|--------------|----------------|------|
> | 🔖 **doc.ref**    | point   | anemic       | one            | handle into a concept (no content itself) |
> | 🌱 **doc.kernel** | seed    | atomic       | one            | minimal expression, fertile for growth |
> | 🪴 **doc.brief**  | carry   | compressed   | one or more    | self-contained, structured, and transferable |
> | 📚 **doc**        | host    | unspecified  | one or more    | general materialization at any scale |"

**relation to wish**: the briefs should be `doc.brief` level compression — compressed but self-contained. the wish's kernelization step (step 1) maps to extraction of `doc.kernel`s from the seed, then cluster and expand into `doc.brief`s.

---

### pattern 4: kernelization

**source**: `kno301.doc.kernelize._.[article].md` [5]

> "**<kernelize>** is the mechanism that extracts 🌱 **doc.kernels** from any 📚 **doc**.
> it reduces unstructured or expansive material into **atomic expressions**, each carrying **one concept**.
> where a 📚 doc may hold many tangled ideas, <kernelize> isolates them into minimal, portable seeds."

> "**one concept only** — every kernel carries exactly one concept
> **atomic** — irreducible without breaking the idea
> **fertile** — can grow into larger articulations (briefs, essays, treatises)
> **portable** — reusable across different contexts and documents"

**relation to wish**: step 1 of the wish is "kernelize the distinct concepts claimed in the seed." the seed contains entangled concepts (post-operator, post-strategist, post-curator, stages of human involvement, red queen dynamics, etc.) that need isolation into atomic kernels before cluster.

---

### pattern 5: enbrief from instances

**source**: `kno301.doc.enbrief.1.from_instances.[article].md` [6]

> "1. **collect instances**
>    - gather relevant observations tied to the concept
>
> 2. **select for salience**
>    - choose the most representative instances
>    - filter out noise or redundancies
>
> 3. **arrange structurally**
>    - organize chosen instances into a compact narrative or argument
>    - highlight how they reveal the concept's pattern or principle
>
> 4. **compress articulation**
>    - distill explanation into a few paragraphs
>    - ensure maximum signal, minimal noise"

**relation to wish**: the seed.md is rich with instances (apples fall → looms, classic developer → khlone delegates, etc.). the enbrief process will select, arrange, and compress these instances into briefs.

---

### pattern 6: articulation mechanism

**source**: `kno301.doc.enbrief.2.articulate.[article].md` [7]

> "**articulate** is the mechanism that **instantiates articles**: it materializes a concept as a definitional treatment that clarifies *what it is*."

> "to articulate 'symmetry,' one defines it as **invariance under transformation**, relating with instances like butterfly wings and geometric rotations.
> to articulate 'leadership,' one defines it as **the capacity to influence and coordinate others**, relating with instances like historical figures or everyday group dynamics.
> to articulate 'entropy,' one defines it as **a measure of multiplicity/uncertainty**, relating with ice melting or shuffled cards."

**relation to wish**: each asymptote concept (post-operator, post-strategist, post-curator) needs articulation:
- post-operator = "when robots are able to execute any declared strategy & fulfill it reliably" [seed]
- post-strategist = "robo ability to strategize the best way to fulfill any objective" [seed]
- post-curator = "robo ability to curate the most desirable taste in future" [seed]

---

### pattern 7: catalog structure

**source**: `kno501.doc.enbrief.catalog.structure1.[article].md` [8]

> "**structure.s1** is a **common structure for a catalog**: it organizes a `$concept` into a set of `$subconcept` clusters, balancing a compressed overview with detailed expansions."

> "1. **compressed overview (table)**
>    - **purpose:** provide a **scannable map** of the `$concept` space
>    - **format:** a table whose **first column is always cluster** (naming each `$subconcept`)
>
> 2. **clusters (expanded sections)**
>    - **purpose:** deepen understanding of each `$subconcept`
>    - **format:** a section per cluster, consisting of:
>      1. **emoji-marked header** — each cluster begins with a **distinct emoji**
>      2. **short description** — 1–3 sentences that summarize the cluster's essence
>      3. **nested outline** — flexible bullet/subbullet structure
>
> 3. **insight (synthesis)**
>    - **purpose:** extract patterns across clusters"

**relation to wish**: the human involvement stages (isolated → extended → competed → surpassed → red-queen) form a natural catalog. the three asymptotes can also be cataloged with their respective restabilization impacts.

---

### pattern 8: actor roles (librarian)

**source**: `kno401.actors.1.role.librarian.[article].md` [9]

> "a **librarian** is the actor that **curates knowledge collections**: rather than authoring new documents, the librarian operates on existing ones, arranging them into coherent systems that make knowledge accessible and durable."

> "- **authors** materialize concepts into *documents*.
> - **librarians** materialize documents into *collections*.
> - mechanisms like **articulate, catalogize, demonstrate, lessonize** operate **within documents**.
> - the **librarian** operates **between documents**, turning scattered works into a coherent knowledge ecology."

**relation to wish**: the wish explicitly requests "distilled librarian style" — the briefs should be curated and arranged into a coherent collection that follows the collegial progression (asym001, asym1xx, asym2xx, etc.).

---

### pattern 9: progressive disclosure numbering

**source**: directory list [1]

the template uses a three-digit numbering scheme:
- first digit = major topic area (1xx=primitives, 2xx=documents, 3xx=compression, etc.)
- second two digits = subtopic order within the area

this maps directly to the wish's requested structure:
- `asym001` = total summary (clifnotes)
- `asym1xx` = fundamental primitives & high-level overview
- `asym2xx` = post-operator
- `asym3xx` = post-strategist
- `asym4xx` = post-curator
- `asym5xx` = synthesis (ecologies, societies, tie-together)

---

### pattern 10: concepts as invariants

**source**: `kno101.primitives.5.concepts.[article].md` [10]

> "**concepts** are the abstract structures — patterns, relationships, or principles — that exist in reality independent of documentation."

> "- **ontic** → exist whether or not they are recognized or documented
> - **structural** → defined by relationships among instances, not by any single instance
> - **stable** → persist across contexts, even if expressed differently"

**relation to wish**: the wish emphasizes that postlabor asymptotes are "inevitable" based on "fundamental truths" and "invariants that are true-by-definition" — not hopes or opinions. the concepts (post-operator, post-strategist, post-curator) are treated as ontic patterns that will manifest regardless of documentation.

---

### pattern 11: demo as relational bridge

**source**: `kno301.doc.enbrief.1.from_instances.[demo].entropy.md` [11]

> "the same set of **instances** (🧊 ice melting, 🃏 shuffling a deck, 🗜️ lossless data compression limits) can be compressed into different **brief archetypes**.
> this demo shows how the concept of **entropy** is materialized differently depending on the treatment: definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical."

the demo shows how one concept (entropy) manifests across all four archetypes:
- 📖 article: "defines entropy as a measure of multiplicity/disorder"
- 🗂️ catalog: maps thermodynamic, statistical, information views
- 🎬 demo: shuffle cards as focal instance
- 🎓 lesson: progressive activities (coin flips → shuffled decks → ice melt → compression)

**relation to wish**: the software development progression (classic dev → rhachet roles → khlone delegates → robot arms race) from the seed is a perfect demo instance for post-operator. similar demo instances should be identified for post-strategist and post-curator.

---

## .application to wish

### map template patterns to wish structure

| wish requirement | template pattern | implementation |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| "asym001 total summary" | compressed overview | `[summary]` archetype at top |
| "asym1xx fundamental primitives" | `kno101.*` pattern | define: asymptote, restabilization, human involvement stages |
| "asym2xx post-operator" | `kno2xx.*` pattern | articles + demos + lessons for post-operator |
| "asym3xx post-strategist" | `kno3xx.*` pattern | articles + demos for post-strategist |
| "asym4xx post-curator" | `kno4xx.*` pattern | articles + demos for post-curator |
| "asym5xx tie together" | `kno5xx.*` pattern | synthesis catalogs, relationship to ecologies/societies |

### kernel extraction from seed (step 1 of wish)

the seed contains these distinct kernels:

**asymptote definitions**
- 🌱 post-operator = robots execute any declared strategy reliably
- 🌱 post-strategist = robots strategize the best way to fulfill any objective
- 🌱 post-curator = robots curate the most desirable taste/values/priorities

**human involvement stages**
- 🌱 isolated = no robots available
- 🌱 extended = humans leverage robots for subskills
- 🌱 competed = robots are independently competitive
- 🌱 surpassed = robots regularly surpass human performance
- 🌱 red-queen = robots compete against robots

**restabilization impacts**
- 🌱 post-operator → restabilization of employment & survival
- 🌱 post-strategist → restabilization of business & ecosystems
- 🌱 post-curator → restabilization of independence

**outcome invariants**
- 🌱 floors raised = all accessible to all
- 🌱 ceilings unbound = all wishes feasible
- 🌱 walls enforced = agency protection
- 🌱 time as singular constraint = ultimate frontier

**human frontiers**
- 🌱 post-labor frontier = to explore + to express
- 🌱 enriched companions with unlimited freedoms
- 🌱 spoiled, constrained only by walls that keep harm away
