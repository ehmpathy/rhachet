take this seed of thoughts on the postlabor asymptotes

.behavior/v2026_01_25.postlabor-asymptotes/.ref/seed.md


and distill it into briefs


---

distilled librarian style
- as demonstrated here; https://github.com/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-bhrain/tree/main/src/domain.roles/thinker/briefs/knowledge

we'll want to structure it in that same incremental knowledge accumulation progression that you'd find at any college

asym001 total summary, for folks who just want an overview & clifnotes
asym1xx which distill the fundamental primitive concepts the rest will build on && a high level overview
asym2xx which distill post-operator
asym3xx which distill post-strategist
asym4xx which distill post-curator
asym5xx which tie it all together and relate it to ecologies and societies


---

these are questions & explorations that are forced by the rapid evolution of robot brains and their involvement in everyday life

given that we are rapidly approaching post-labor asymptotes along each dimension simultaneously

it is prudent to be aware of what the stablestates will likely be and what to expect

that way, we can know where to prioritize our labor, while it is still relevant - and how long which kinds of labor may be relevant for

---

further, hopefully it can help us make choices to ratchet in the better stable states of each case for all, and raise the floor, sooner than later


---

the overall objective is that at the end of it all

- the floors are raised; all is accessible to all, all effect to all people
- the ceils are unbound; all wishes are feasible; explorable or fulfillable. only question is cost.time
- the walls are enforced; treat all as you would be treated; systemic live and let live freedom & equality, with enforced agency protection


---

the singular constraint that remains at the end of it all is
- time

time is the only constraint that will never be eliminated; time limit, too, of heatdeath

so,
- all curation and decisions are ultimatley measureable in cost.time
- cost.cash goes to zero, as there is infinite parallelism -> no resource contention to barter for


---

the ultimate frontier left for humans to spend time on becomes
- to explore (concepts, space, diversity, etc)
- to express (live, emote, experience, etc)

as all surivival, strategic, and curation labor has superceeded human capabilities by robots

(humans will only do it out of hobby, or self enrichment)

---

perhaps we will end up as enriched companions with ultimate freedom

co-ordinated in the objective to spread life and understand the universe


---

in effect, postlabor eliminates the human competitiveness for each of these

- post-operator -> hands; human.hands are no longer competitive
- post-strategist -> brains; human.brains are no longer competitive
- post-curator -> guts; human.guts are no longer competitive


----

note, that we want to capture the observation that likely

- post-operator
- post-strategist
- post-curator

are indpenednent, orthogonal dimensions

&&

the progression of competitiveness of humans vs robots along each dimension will
- vary along subdimensions (eg., application to different domains)
- vary in duration in how long it takes to acheive replacement
- &&
- post-replacement of human, will in some cases always have an arms race of constant evolutionary competitive pressure to continue to evolve in capability. (up to what limit?)
  - especially post strategy, for competivie businesses, unless they union like lightbulb manufacturerers, but that itself would be unstable due to hte ease of entries for incumbants, so yes, no moat is safe -> red queen arms race forever for strategy. maybe for others too, as long as there is an incentive to improve (i.e., greater gains or merit or repute; probably will always be something)


but we should make it clear on each dimension

where
1. humans are isolated (no robots available )
2. humans are extended by robots (humans start leverage of robots via delegation of subskills while in controll of entrypoint skills)
3. humans are competed by robots (even with robot extensions for humans, robots on their own are now competitive, as there is no skill left in the domain that the robot cant do)
4. humans are surpassed by robots (robots now regularly surpass human performance, unassisted; these skills of robots, however, were still distilled via human in the loop)
5. robots are competed by robots (robots are now in a red queen arms race with eachother, where even their own skills are produced by robots; humans are not competitive at all)


---

for example

1. humans are isolated = classic software developer
2. humans are extended by robots = leverage rhachet roles to produce software (robots write, blueprint, etc), but humans still drive the process and closely review.
3. humans are competed by robots = leverage khlone delegates to produce software (robots do everything, e.g., foreman drives architect,mechanic,reviewer to coordinate and verify sucessful delivery)
4. humans are surpassed by robots = dependent on khlone delegates to produce software (human labor in software production is non-competitive; all software is done primarily via khlones)
5. robots are competed by robots = khlone delegates tune the rhachet roles that other khlone delegates produce software with; its an arms race of who will produce better software faster via ratchet effects on roles leveraged by khlones to build more efficient & more effective khlones

that's a progression sequence in the post-operator dimension that would show the asymptote of red-queen and the progression points of human involvement


--------

note, we'll wan't to approach this problem as a rigid skill

1 = kernelize the distinct concepts claimed in the seed and wish
2 = cluster citations together and identify interdependencies
3 = construct a treestruct of progressive disclosure of concepts that would fit in the collegial asym1xx->asym2xx->etc progression and guide a reader through the full discorse
4 = propose the breakdown of briefs that would document this without loss of any concepts but with maximal isolation of distinct concepts && connection via distinct connector articles
5 = only then, execute, and write the briefs

the briefs to be written into .agent/repo=.this/role=ecologist/briefs/postlabor.asymptotes


------

note: one important thing to make clear is that

- we think this is the inevitable future, based on fundamental truths

this isn't a hope
this isn't a wish
this is an exploration of the most likely outcome based on systemic fundamentals

i.e., this is the inevitable future that robot brains produce

---

a next question is, how do humans fit in and achieve fulfillemnt in life within this future?

but before we digress into that, we want to first formalize what the future will inevitably look like.

we want to clearly mark all "assumptions" and ideally eliminate them, as nothing in this distillation should be "assumed" or variable

the whole distillation should be based entirely on invariants that are true-by-definition

e.g.,
- given: robots do the same work better and faster than humans
- then: human labor is not competitive and will not be employable at scale

that's a fundamental truth; devoid of any opinion

each asymptote and foresight distilled here should similarly be based on fundamental invariants.

and we should call out any structural claims that we think are questionable

defo peer review and mark for refinement or elimination
