today, emojis render weird based on which terminal they're in

emojis like 🪨 && 🦫 consume
- 1 space in front of them, in vscode's integrated terminal
- 0 space in front of them, in debian's standard terminal

emojis like 🌩️ consume
- 1 space in front of them, in vscode's integrated terminal
- 1 space in front of them, in debian's standard terminal

our goal is to shim console.log so that, based on a dictionary, if we see one of the known frontspace consumers, we automatically adjust the frontspaces ahead of that emoji

e.g.,

given(the beaver 🦫 emoji is logged with message "🦫 let's review!")
  given(terminal is vscode integrated)
    when(console log is run with that beaver emoji)
      then(the message is adjusted to "🦫  let's review!")
        because(the frontspace for this emoji + this terminal was registered as `1`)
        sothat(the message renders correctly to "🦫 let's review!" in this terminal)
  given(terminal is not vscode integrated)
    when(console log is run with that beaver emoji)
      then(the message is not adjusted, stays as "🦫 let's review!")
        because(the frontspace for this emoji + this terminal was registered as `0`)
        sothat(the message renders correctly to "🦫 let's review!" in this terminal)


given(the beaver 🦫 emoji is logged with message "🦫  let's review!")
  given(terminal is vscode integrated)
    when(console log is run with that beaver emoji)
      then(the message is adjusted to "🦫   let's review!")
        sothat(the message renders correctly to "🦫  let's review!" afterwards)


given(the beaver 🦫 emoji is logged with message "⛈️ woah!")
  given(terminal is vscode integrated)
    when(console log is run with that beaver emoji)
      then(the message is adjusted to "⛈️  woah!")
        because(the frontspace for this emoji + this terminal was registered as `1`)
        sothat(the message renders correctly to "⛈️ woah!" in this terminal)
  given(terminal is not vscode integrated)
    when(console log is run with that beaver emoji)
      then(the message is adjusted to "⛈️  woah!")
        because(the frontspace for this emoji + this terminal was registered as `1`)
        sothat(the message renders correctly to "⛈️ woah!" in this terminal)

the core question becomes
- how can we determine whether we are running in vscode's integrated terminal?
