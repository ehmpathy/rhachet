wish =

had a command called

`npx rhachet update`

which ran with flags

`--self` to update self

`--roles ${list of roles}` to update the list of roles, similar to how `npx rhachet init --roles` operates

---

what it should do is issue an

`npm install rhachet@latest $rolesRepo1@latest`

where rhachet@latest is added to install list due to --self flag

and each $rolesRepo1@latest is added per repo found per role from the --roles flag (with / disambiguation, as usual)

---

then, it should issue an

`npx rhachet init --roles $roles`

to initialize all those roles again too
