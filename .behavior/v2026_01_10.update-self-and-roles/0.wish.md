wish =

had a command called

`npx rhachet upgrade`

which ran with flags

`--self` to upgrade self

`--roles ${list of roles}` to upgrade the list of roles, similar to how `npx rhachet init --roles` operates

---

what it should do is issue an

`npm install rhachet@latest $rolesRepo1@latest`

where rhachet@latest is added to install list due to --self flag

and each $rolesRepo1@latest is added per repo found per role from the --roles flag (with / disambiguation, as usual)

---

then, it should issue an

`npx rhachet init --roles $roles`

to initialize all those roles again too


----

npx rhachet upgrade , by default, should invoke --self
  and --roles * ; --roles * should discover all the
  roles that are already linked and reuse them
