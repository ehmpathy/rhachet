# domain terms research: briefs compression

## .scope

what domain.objects are needed for the briefs compression feature, and what should we call them?

---

## .inventory: domain.objects required

from the wish, vision, and criteria, these are the domain concepts that need names:

| concept | nature | what it represents |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| the source file | literal | human-readable `.md` brief |
| the compressed file | literal | machine-optimized `.md.comp` brief |
| the compression process/command | operation | transform `.md` → `.md.comp` |
| the file extension | convention | `.md.comp` or alternative |
| the loader preference behavior | operation | prefer `.comp` when available |
| the orphan detection | operation | failfast when `.comp` exists without `.md` |
| the compression technique | literal | the method used (TSC, etc) |

### relationships

```
BriefSource (.md)
  └─ derives → BriefCompressed (.md.comp)
       └─ orphan without source = defect (failfast)

Role.briefs.dirs
  └─ contains → BriefSource[] + BriefCompressed[]
       └─ loader prefers compressed when both exist
```

the compressed form is **derived from** and **cannot exist without** the source. this is the core invariant.

## .cross-domain research

### 1. publishing / typography

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **precis** | concise summary, ~15% of original [1] | medium — human summary, not machine optimization |
| **epitome** | from greek *epitemnein* "to cut short, abridge" [2] | strong etymology, but modern meaning shifted to "perfect example of" |
| **digest** | condensed compilation that preserves essential meaning [1] | medium — implies curation |
| **abridgment** | shortened version that retains core meaning [1] | medium — generic |
| **condensed** (typography) | font narrowed but less aggressive than "compressed" [3] | notable: in typography, **compressed > condensed** in aggressiveness |

> "abridgment, abstract, synopsis, conspectus and epitome all mean a condensed treatment." — [1]

> "epitome" from greek *epitemnein* "cut short, abridge," from *epi* "into" + *temnein* "to cut" — [2]

> "the narrowest proportion is described as ultra compressed, with descriptive width names usually progressing to extra compressed, compressed, condensed, regular and extended." — [3]

### 2. distillation / chemistry

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **distillate** | purified liquid from distillation; concentrated essence [4] | strong — purification + concentration |
| **essence** | volatile, characteristic properties extracted from a substance [4] | strong — "same flavor, less volume" |
| **concentrate** | substance with increased solute after solvent removal | strong — literal meaning matches |
| **absolute** (perfumery) | most concentrated form, 80-90% aromatic substances [5] | strong — "most concentrated extractable form" |
| **tincture** | distillate diluted in carrier | inverse — dilution, not concentration |

> "a distillate is the product of distillation and a concentrated essence." — [4]

> "figuratively, it means to obtain the essence, the concentrated article, uncontaminated and undiluted by anything else." — [6]

> "absolutes are the most concentrated form of fragrance (and the most costly)." — [5]

the metaphor maps perfectly: source `.md` = crude material; compression process = distillation; `.comp` output = distillate.

**risk:** "distillation" is already used in ML (knowledge distillation [7]), creating overlap.

### 3. culinary

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **glace** (fr. "glaze") | stock reduced to 1/10th original volume; syrup-like concentrated meat essence [8] | very strong — extreme concentration ratio |
| **demi-glace** (fr. "half-glaze") | stock reduced to 1/4 to 1/2 original volume [9] | strong — the "demi" prefix is evocative |
| **reduction** | process of simmering to evaporate water and concentrate flavor [9] | strong for the *process*, not the artifact |
| **bouillon** | concentrated flavoring in cube form; reconstitutes to stock with water [10] | strong — portable, reconstitutable |

> "glace de viande is a french meat glaze made by reducing stock to about one-tenth of its original volume, resulting in a concentrated brown stock." — [8]

> "demi-glace is created by reducing stock by about half, lending it its name--which means 'half-glaze'." — [9]

> "bouillon is made from highly concentrated meat or vegetable stocks, and when reconstituted with water, becomes stock." — [10]

**glace** has a 10:1 ratio that roughly matches the before/after in the vision doc (700→150 tokens). **bouillon** captures the "reconstitutable" nature — the LLM reconstitutes telegraphic text into full meaning.

### 4. information theory / compression

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **minification** | remove unnecessary characters without changing functionality [11] | very strong — already the mental model in the vision doc |
| **semantic compression** | data reduction that preserves meaning [12] | precise — exactly what TSC does |
| **lossy compression** | removes less important information [13] | accurate — articles removed, rules preserved |
| **source coding** | encoding with fewer bits than original [13] | too technical |

> "minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from the source code... without changing its functionality." — [11]

> "all major javascript library developers provide minified versions of their files for production deployments, usually denoted with a 'min.js' name extension." — [11]

> "semantic compression recasts the problem of data reduction from minimizing raw distortion to preserving meaning." — [12]

**critical distinction:** JS minification is *lossless* (behavior-preserved). brief compression is *lossy* (prose removed, signal preserved). this matters for term choice.

### 5. military / telegraphy

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **telegraphese** / **cablese** | clipped prose that strips articles, pronouns, filler to minimize per-word cost [14] | very strong — this IS the technique described |
| **brevity code** | standardized short words that convey complex information [15] | strong — conveys "dense signal" |
| **SITREP** | concise status report format; "brevity is paramount" [16] | medium — specific format |

> "telegram style is a clipped way of writing which abbreviates words and packs information into the smallest possible number of words or characters." — [14]

> "cablese referred to condensed telegraphic messaging that made heavy use of abbreviations and avoided use of definite or indefinite articles, punctuation, and other words unnecessary for comprehension." — [14]

> "the style developed to minimize costs but still convey the message clearly and unambiguously." — [14]

the **telegraph metaphor** is the deepest match: communication compressed because the channel (context window) is expensive per word, just like telegraph charged per word. the technique (strip articles, keep nouns+verbs) is identical to TSC.

### 6. cartography

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **generalization** | derive smaller-scale map from larger-scale one [17] | strong — umbrella process |
| **simplification** | remove vertices/detail while retaining important characteristics [17] | strong — matches "remove noise, keep signal" |
| **typification** | replace many similar features with fewer representative ones [18] | medium — matches dedup/merge |

> "generalization seeks to abstract spatial information at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered at a lower level of detail." — [17]

> "the challenge lies in how to depict the geography as faithfully as possible while reducing extraneous detail and preserving the characteristic arrangement of the data." — [18]

elegant framing: detailed map (`.md`) is *generalized* into small-scale map (`.comp`) that preserves essential geography while removing detail the viewer does not need at that zoom level. but "generalization" is overloaded in ML.

### 7. music

| term | definition | fit |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **reduction** | arrangement where complexity is lessened; orchestral work for piano [19] | very strong — same content, adapted for different consumer |
| **condensed score** / **particella** | principal parts on 2-4 staves; basic melodies and harmony [19] | strong — same music, fewer staves |
| **lead sheet** | essential elements only: melody, lyrics, harmony [20] | very strong — "essential elements only" |
| **short score** | focuses on "big picture without getting lost in orchestrational details" [19] | strong — matches intent |

> "a reduction in music is an arrangement or transcription of an existing score in which complexity is lessened to make analysis, performance, or practice easier or clearer." — [19]

> "a lead sheet specifies the essential elements of a popular song: the melody, lyrics and harmony... does not describe the chord voicings, voice leading, bass line or other aspects." — [20]

**piano reduction** maps perfectly: same musical content, expressed for a different consumer (pianist vs orchestra), with complexity removed that the target consumer does not need.

### 8. construction / blue collar

this domain is an **inverse** of the pattern. shop drawings are *more* detailed than architectural drawings [21]. not useful for this feature.

## .proposed terms: the domain.objects

### the source file: `BriefSource`

**what it is:** the human-readable `.md` file that role authors write and edit.

no new name needed. the existing term "brief" already names this. the `.md` file is the brief. the vision doc calls it "source" — as in `.js` source vs `.min.js`.

**candidates considered:**

| option | why yes | why no |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `BriefSource` | clear origin semantics; matches "source code" | slightly redundant — the `.md` IS the brief |
| `Brief` | already the term | doesn't disambiguate from compressed form |
| `BriefFull` | explicit about completeness | implies the compressed form is incomplete |

**recommendation: `BriefSource`** — or just "brief" when unambiguous. the `.md` is the source. the source is the brief.

### the compressed file: three options

this is the key naming decision. three strong options, each from a different domain:

#### option A: `BriefMin` / `.md.min` — from minification

| dimension | assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **specificity** | high — `.min.js` is universally understood in software |
| **intuition** | very high — developers immediately know "minified = same behavior, less bytes" |
| **analogy depth** | the vision doc already uses this analogy explicitly |
| **risk** | minification is traditionally *lossless*; brief compression is *lossy*. this is a meaningful difference. a minified JS file preserves all behavior; a minified brief drops articles and verbose examples. the term slightly overpromises fidelity. |
| **file extension** | `.md.min` — clean, familiar, short |

#### option B: `BriefDistilled` / `.md.dist` — from distillation

| dimension | assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **specificity** | high — distillate = concentrated essence, purified from crude |
| **intuition** | medium-high — the chemistry metaphor is evocative but less immediately obvious than `.min` |
| **analogy depth** | deep. source = crude material; compression = distillation; output = distillate (concentrated essence). the "you can't have a distillate without source material" invariant maps to the orphan detection requirement. |
| **risk** | `.dist` collides with `dist/` directory convention in JS projects. "distillation" is used in ML (knowledge distillation [7]). |
| **file extension** | `.md.dist` — evocative but collision-prone |

#### option C: `BriefReduced` / `.md.red` — from music reduction

| dimension | assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **specificity** | high — "reduction" = same content, adapted for a different consumer with complexity removed |
| **intuition** | high — "piano reduction" is a perfect metaphor (full orchestra → piano, full prose → telegraphese) |
| **analogy depth** | deep. the dual-domain resonance (music + culinary) strengthens it. a reduction in cooking = concentrate flavor by removing water. a reduction in music = concentrate content by removing orchestration. both map to "concentrate signal by removing noise." |
| **risk** | `.red` could confuse with "redaction" (blacking out sensitive info) or the color red. also "reduce" has MapReduce connotations in CS. |
| **file extension** | `.md.red` — ambiguous |

#### option D: `BriefCompressed` / `.md.comp` — as declared in the vision doc

| dimension | assessment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **specificity** | medium — "compressed" is generic; could mean zip, gzip, semantic compression |
| **intuition** | medium-high — clear meaning but not evocative |
| **analogy depth** | shallow — compression is a general-purpose term without metaphorical richness |
| **risk** | could confuse with "compiled" (`.comp`). but vision doc already establishes this convention. |
| **file extension** | `.md.comp` — already designed and documented |

### the compression process/command

**candidates:**

| option | domain source | assessment |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `briefs compress` | information theory | already in vision doc; generic but clear |
| `briefs distill` | chemistry | evocative — "distill the briefs into concentrated form" |
| `briefs reduce` | music/culinary | evocative — "reduce the briefs for machine consumption" |
| `briefs minify` | web/JS | developer-friendly — "minify the briefs" |

the command name should match the artifact name. if the file is `.md.min`, the command is `briefs minify`. if `.md.dist`, the command is `briefs distill`. consistency matters.

### the compression technique: TSC (telegraphic semantic compression)

already named in the research brief [22]. the technique is telegraphese [14] applied with semantic awareness. "TSC" is a good acronym. no rename needed.

### the loader preference behavior

no new term needed. this is just the boot loader's file resolution logic: "prefer `.comp` (or `.min` or `.dist`) when available, fall back to `.md`."

### the orphan detection

no new term needed. this is a failfast guard: "if derived artifact exists without source, throw."

## .evaluation matrix

| dimension | `.md.min` (minify) | `.md.dist` (distill) | `.md.red` (reduce) | `.md.comp` (compress) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **specificity** | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| **intuition** (developer) | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| **analogy depth** | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★☆☆☆ |
| **collision risk** | ★★★★★ (low) | ★★☆☆☆ (dist/ dir) | ★★☆☆☆ (redaction) | ★★★☆☆ (compiled) |
| **accuracy** | ★★★☆☆ (lossless vs lossy) | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ |
| **brevity** | 3 chars | 4 chars | 3 chars | 4 chars |

---

## .recommendation

### tier 1: `.md.min` (minify)

**strongest choice for developer adoption.** the `.min.js` convention is universal. developers immediately understand "minified = same behavior, less bytes, for machine consumption." the term is short, the extension is clean, the mental model is pre-installed in every web developer's brain.

the lossy-vs-lossless distinction is a real imperfection. but the vision doc already uses this exact analogy ("you know how javascript has `.min.js`"). lean into it.

command: `npx rhachet briefs minify --repo ehmpathy --role mechanic`
extension: `.md.min`
domain object: `BriefMinified` (or just the `.min` convention, no domain object needed)

### tier 2: `.md.comp` (compress) — the status quo

already designed. already documented. clear enough. generic but not wrong. if `.md.min` feels too overloaded with lossless connotations, `.md.comp` is a safe default.

command: `npx rhachet briefs compress --repo ehmpathy --role mechanic`
extension: `.md.comp`

### tier 3: `.md.dist` (distill) — the poetic choice

deepest metaphorical richness. "distill the briefs" is evocative and accurate. but the `dist/` directory collision makes it impractical for file extensions. better suited as the *conceptual framing* than the *file extension*.

---

## .proposed vocabulary (ubiquitous language)

| term | definition | when to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **brief** | human-readable `.md` knowledge file | always — the source is the brief |
| **brief minified** | machine-optimized `.md.min` compressed brief | when referring to the compressed artifact |
| **minify** | the process of compressing a brief for machine consumption | the cli command verb |
| **TSC** | telegraphic semantic compression — the technique | when discussing how compression works |
| **source** | the `.md` file from which the `.min` is derived | when disambiguating source from minified |
