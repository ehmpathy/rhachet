wish =

we had aws support for AWS_SSO and their requirement of AWS_PROFILE envvar, per 

- .behavior/v2026_02_09.keyrack-aws/.refs/eval.grant-mech-aws-sso.md

sepcifically, need to etend key.grade.protection to include 'reference', since some of our keys are actually just references

need to also ensure taht the EPHEMERAL_VIA_AWS_SSO verifies that the sso creds are still usable

e.g.,

the AWS_PROFILE secret will be granted as `ehmpathy.demo` for example. when it is, we need to verify that it is indeed usable still, via get caller identity

and if not, need to unlock via the vault that knows how to handle that type of credential

e.g., aws.iam.sso vault
