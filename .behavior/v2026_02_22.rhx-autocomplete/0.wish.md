wish =

that rhx had an autocomplete feature

so that when i type `rhx route.st<tab><tab>` (where <tab> = keypress tab on keyboard)

then i should see all the options via normal unix autocomplete and be able to cycle through them 

e.g., tab should do the autocomplete (up to next common branch path)

and tab tab should do the "show options" flow or whatever is normal

---

related, we should have an `rhx list` which shows all options and a `rhx search` which enables the user to type and search while we show the options below (should search both the help and the names)
