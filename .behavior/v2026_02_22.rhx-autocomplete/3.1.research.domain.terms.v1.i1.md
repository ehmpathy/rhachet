# research: domain terms

## objective

coin terms for new domain objects that:
- maximize specificity → eliminate ambiguity & minimize confusion
- maximize intuition → eliminate friction & maximize adoption

to create a ubiquitous language.

## term analysis: executable capabilities

### candidate terms

| term | domain origin | connotation | specificity | intuition |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **skill** | rhachet, HR/talent | learned capability, teachable | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| ability | HR/talent | innate talent, natural aptitude | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| capability | enterprise | what can be done (abstract) | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| command | CLI/unix | imperative action | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ |
| tool | bluecollar/trades | instrument for work | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ |
| recipe | culinary | step-by-step procedure | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ |
| action | games/software | discrete executable unit | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |

### analysis

**skill** is the right term because:

1. **HR domain alignment**: "a repertoire of skills refers to a wide range or collection of abilities, talents, or expertise possessed by an individual or group" [1]

2. **agent/ai domain alignment**: "agent skills work through discovery and on-demand load—agents discover skills when needed, load relevant instructions and resources, and apply that knowledge to the current task" [2]

3. **distinction from ability**: "skills are the ability to apply knowledge to perform specific tasks, while abilities are the natural talents or aptitudes" [3] — skills are learned, abilities are innate

4. **established in rhachet**: already used throughout `.agent/` structure

### verdict: **Skill** ✓

no change needed. term is well-established and semantically precise.

## term analysis: name:description pairs

### candidate terms

| term | domain origin | connotation | specificity | intuition |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **entry** | catalogs | single record in a list | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ |
| candidate | zsh/completion | option under consideration | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| option | UI/forms | selectable choice | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| item | generic | element in collection | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| match | search | result that fits criteria | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |

### parallel domain analysis

**library science**:
- "catalog is the process of create and maintain descriptions of resources" [4]
- catalog entry = single record with metadata

**culinary**:
- menu entry = name + description + price
- recipe card = name + ingredients + steps

**bluecollar/trades**:
- inventory entry = part name + description + location
- "all products are stored in one centralized catalog" [5]

### zsh context

zsh's `_describe` uses "name:description" pairs:
```zsh
skills=(
  'git.commit.set:create git commit'
  'perf.test:measure CLI time'
)
_describe 'skill' skills
```

### verdict: **CompletionEntry** ✓

compound term that is:
- self-documents: clearly about completion system
- specific: not confused with other "entry" types
- aligned with zsh vocabulary

## term analysis: role namespace

### candidate terms

| term | domain origin | connotation | specificity | intuition |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **repo** | git/software | repository of code | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| registry | npm/docker | collection of packages | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| catalog | retail/library | organized collection | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| namespace | code | scope for names | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ |
| bucket | cloud/s3 | container for objects | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ |

### parallel domain analysis

**software packages**:
- npm registry = collection of packages
- docker registry = collection of images
- "a data catalog is a centralized metadata repository" [6]

**culinary**:
- cookbook = collection of recipes by author/cuisine
- menu = collection of dishes by restaurant

**trades**:
- toolbox = collection of tools by tradesperson
- toolkit = bundled set of tools for purpose

### analysis

**RoleRepo** (role repository) because:
- aligns with git terminology (familiar to developers)
- emphasizes ownership/source (`.this` vs `ehmpathy`)
- "repository" implies versioned, maintained collection

alternative considered: **RoleRegistry**
- more aligned with npm/docker conventions
- implies discoverability and lookup
- but: "provider" vs "supplier" consideration — registry implies agent provision, repo implies mechanism supply [7]

### verdict: **RoleRepo** ✓

keep as-is. the `.this` vs `ehmpathy` slug pattern maps naturally to repo semantics.

## term analysis: skill groups

### candidate terms

| term | domain origin | connotation | specificity | intuition |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **role** | HR/theater | set of responsibilities | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| persona | UX/market | fictional user archetype | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| profile | systems | configuration set | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| toolkit | trades | bundled tools for purpose | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| repertoire | arts | full supply of what you can do | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ |

### parallel domain analysis

**arts**:
- "repertoire refers to the full supply of what you can do—a vocalist's repertoire is all the songs they can perform" [1]
- role = character played by actor

**HR/organizational**:
- role = job function with associated responsibilities
- "a repertoire of practice refers to the sum of available tools, techniques, strategies" [1]

**culinary**:
- station = area of kitchen with specific skills (e.g., saucier, garde manger)
- chef de partie = chef responsible for particular station

### analysis

**Role** is ideal because:
- maps to `.agent/repo=*/role=*/` structure
- implies bundled skills + briefs for a purpose
- familiar from HR (job role) and theater (character role)
- aligns with `rhachet-roles-*` package name

**Repertoire** considered but rejected:
- great metaphor for "all skills available"
- but: role is the container, repertoire is the collection of what a role can do
- could say: "the mechanic role has a repertoire of skills"

### verdict: **Role** ✓

keep as-is. well-established and semantically precise.

## term analysis: repo root concept

### candidate terms

| term | domain origin | connotation | specificity | intuition |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **root** | filesystem | top-level directory | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ |
| base | construction | foundation | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| home | unix | user's primary directory | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| anchor | nautical | fixed reference point | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| workspace | IDE | project container | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |

### analysis

**RepoRootPath** because:
- "root" is universal in filesystem contexts
- "repo root" specifically means: directory with `.git/` or `.agent/`
- compound term self-documents

### verdict: **RepoRootPath** ✓

keep as-is. standard terminology.

---

## term analysis: events

### candidate terms for discovery event

| term | connotation | domain |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **discovered** | found through exploration | exploration |
| found | located | generic |
| detected | noticed via system | monitors |
| registered | added to registry | administration |
| indexed | added to searchable index | search engines |

**SkillDiscovered** is preferred:
- implies active scan process
- "discovery" is used in service discovery, api discovery
- more evocative than "found" or "detected"

### candidate terms for completion event

| term | connotation | domain |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **generated** | produced output | fabrication |
| emitted | output as signal/stream | systems |
| rendered | visual output produced | graphics |
| compiled | transformed to output form | compilers |

**CompletionGenerated** is preferred:
- implies code was produced
- "generated" is standard for code generation
- matches `rhachet completion` — generates completion code

### verdict: keep event names ✓

- **SkillDiscovered** — skill file found in `.agent/` scan
- **CompletionGenerated** — completion code output to stdout
- **CacheRefreshed** — completion cache updated for repo

---

## summary: term decisions

| concept | term | why |
|---------|------|-----|
| executable capability | **Skill** | established, precise, aligns with HR/agent domains |
| bundle of skills | **Role** | established, maps to theater/HR, matches structure |
| role namespace | **RoleRepo** | aligns with git, implies versioned collection |
| name:description pair | **CompletionEntry** | self-documents, zsh-aligned |
| repo root path | **RepoRootPath** | standard fs terminology |
| skill found event | **SkillDiscovered** | evokes active scan |
| completion output event | **CompletionGenerated** | standard code generation term |
| cache update event | **CacheRefreshed** | clear action + state |

---

## no new terms needed

all terms are either:
1. **established in rhachet** — Skill, Role, RoleRepo
2. **standard in zsh/shell** — CompletionEntry, compadd, _describe
3. **standard in filesystem** — RepoRootPath, cwd
4. **clear compound terms** — self-document via composition

the ubiquitous language is already well-formed. focus implementation on these terms.

## parallel domain inspiration

| domain | term used | analogous to |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **culinary** | recipe, menu, cookbook | skill, list, roleRepo |
| **theater** | role, repertoire, cast | role, getAllSkills, actors |
| **trades** | tool, toolbox, toolkit | skill, .agent/, role |
