wish =

that the boot command looked for a `boot.yml` in the role it was invoked against

the boot.yml should allow the role to specify

which briefs to 
- say

vs

which briefs to 
- ref


the briefs to `say` will get injected into context as normal today


the briefs to `ref` will only get a relative path reference injected into the context (no contents)

that way, the agent can know that the refs exist (tree struct styl)

but not need to see all of them

making it easy to lookup more info, but not yet with the burden of those tokens in context

---

we need to make it so that the boot.yml is auto linked into the agent dir

if its path present in the role config (and subsequent introspected manifest)

so that its ultra portable, as usual


----------
--

lets also specifically focus on the concept of 

usecase scoped subsets

ie., if a role chooses to boot into a "--usecase X", then we should support that

we should specify inheritance via collections of subjects 

e.g.,

{ subject: { slug, briefs: { say, ref }, skills: { say, ref } }

---

or maybe ,better yet

everything is ref by default unless explicitly globbed via say

---

or, maybe, atleast specify a preset list of subjects to start with

then, roles can boot a subset of subjects

or by default all of them

---

so, 

subject.$x
  - say: x,y,z 
  - ref: a,b,c (explicitly ref as part of the subject)

subject.$y
  - say: m,n,l
  - ref: o,p,q

---

and everything that isn't said or reffed explicitly in any subject is enumerated in an

'also' section in the boot 

(unless a specific subset of subjects was selected, then only those subjects are booted)

---

and if a set of subjects was prescribed and there's overlap, then 
- on ref dupe, repeat the ref
- on say dupe, 'say "as mentioned earlier" and degrade to ref

---

and lets ensure there's one set of briefs and skills that can be prescribed as 'always'

-----

however, lets ensure this is progressive complexity

i.e., 

by default, boot.yml files can jsut declare 

breifs
  say:
   - glob1
   - glob2
   -...

skills:
  say:
    - glob1
    - glob2


---

if briefs or skills dont have a say, assume all is say by default

if say is declared and something is not in say, then its ref by default


---

then, separatly allow the 

always

subject.* 

pattern,

if someone says either subject or always, then failfast if briefs or skills are toplevel

no mixed declarations; simple or subject mode only, pick a lane and stay in it
