demo how we can invoke claude code via shell

demo how it can be invoked with an isolated context
- e.g., what if we only want to give it...
  - a subset of the `.briefs` dir in a repo
  - a subset of the repo itself
  - access to a .shell command to search the web, which runs through our own safety monitors
