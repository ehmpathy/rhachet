[wish.1] =
  - .what = able to harness state-of-the-art (sota) agents (e.g., claude-code) within rhachet
  - .why =
    - dont need to recreate the wheel; enables _any_ robot:brain to be used, not just ones built via rhachet
      - => folks can bring their favorite brains
    - can add the determinisitc rhachet behavior ontop of those brains
      - compose thought routes && thought systems
      - e.g.,
        - <produce> =
          - <prepare>[$product]
          - <review>[$product]
            - .format = (e.g., BLOCKERS + NITPICKS)
            - .directions = [criteria, security, coherance, omissions, ambiguity, ...]
          - <release>[$product]

rationale =

- the rhachet framework applies super well to adhoc usage of claude
  - boot briefs
  - declare ask
    - .src
  - get attempts
    - i1, i2, i3
  - run route
    - propose
    - review x3
    - release


would be great to automate that && guarantee it checks against each of the checks we want

&& maximal gain would be from parallel attempts && auto self review
