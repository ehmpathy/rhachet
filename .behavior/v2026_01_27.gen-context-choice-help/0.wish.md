  // generate context with choice via rhachet's genContextBrain

    return genContextBrain({ atoms, repls, choice: input.brain });
  } catch (error) {
    // wrap rhachet's error with our formatted help message
    if (error instanceof BadRequestError && error.message.includes('not found'))

wish we emitted a similar outcome, where we helpfully enumerated the available brains (up to 21) when the target brain was not found

bonus points for string similarity sort


so that consumers of this lib didn't have to do as above, and add it themselves
