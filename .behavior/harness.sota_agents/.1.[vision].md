vision

- rhachet handles creation of isolated workspaces within which claude instances can run
  - locally
  - or
  - remotely

- rhachets normal tools operate as usual
  - attempts
  - routes
  - briefs
  - context isolation
  - etc

- rhachet shell skill composition operates as normal

the only real difference a user would experience is
- if the skill doesn't constrain the --brain to use
- then user can say --brain = 'claude:code:opusv4.5' for example, and we'll use it, and spinup the workspace required to isolate its context as desired

-----

main utility will also be
- background tasks => (eventually, e.g., launch via rhachet app)
- background feedbacks => system for relaible feedback
- background reflection => proposals for how to improve thought routes based on feedbacks
  - brief upgrades
  - skill upgrades
  - route upgrades
