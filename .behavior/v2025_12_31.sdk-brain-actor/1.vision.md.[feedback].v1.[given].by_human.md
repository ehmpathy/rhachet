# blocker.1

`genBrainRepl` from `rhachet-brains-anthropic` and use
  as `genBrainRepl({ slug: 'claude/code' })`


# blocker.2

> explain that when --brain is declared via cli, the brain must
  have been registered via rhachet.use.ts && requires the
  $repo/$slug pattern for identification (e.g., --brain
  openai/codex vs --brain anthropic/claude/code


# blocker.3

explain that rhachet will  need to make it easy to typestrong
  the .act,.run skills invokable via the actors (e.g., via a
  factory to genActor via role); ultimately, mechanic = an actor
  from genActor


# blocker.4

> skills cant be type inferred with todays implementation, since
 many are directory driven. we'll have to extend the
`role.skills` to support `role.skills.rigid` and
`role.skills.solid` and `role.skills.fluid`, each of which will
then take a zod input and output schema, which will be usable to
 infer the types ; we'll want to mark the .refs skills as 'to
deprecate' and the .dirs skills as 'not inferrable via actor
sdk, unless explicitly registered'

# blocker.5

genActor should take an allowlsit of brains that it supports
  invocation of. that way, we dont need a rhachet.use.ts to have
  the --brain flag resolvable - and it can choose a default from
  teh first in the list - and it can ensure that only supported
  brains are allowlisted

---

# blocker.6

same for when its declared via .act({ brain }). it should
allow for either `{ brain: RefByUnique<typeof BrainRepl> }`,
which would invoke lookup - or direct { brain: BrainRepl }
passin, if custom configs are desired; in both cases, if not in
the allowlist by unique, then throws an error - for security.
(roles only allow allowlisted brains) (we can revisit this in
the future if we decide to loosen)
