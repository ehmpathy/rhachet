wish that when we ran npx rhachet upgrade

it fould all of the role packages, just like it finds all the brain packages

---

today it only upgrades the 'linked' roles

but we want it to upgrade all the packages from package.json, just like it does for brains

---


e.g., discoverRolePackages 

w/ whatever RoleSupplierSlug would make it symmetric with the brain pattern

---

that way, regardless of whether any of those packages have linked roles in the repo already (e.g., maybe link wasnt run yet) - they'll all be upgraded before the link, ready to be linked fresh and annew
