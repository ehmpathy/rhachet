wish that actor brain operation `actor.ask()`

supported usage of `BrainAtom`, in addition to `BrainRepl`

since both BrainAtom and BrainRepl support .ask() interface, no reason why we cant use .ask() with `actor.ask()` too

---

we also want to demonstrate this behavior via a integration test demo that proves we can invoke `actor.ask()` against a goal to write prose about the `sunshine ocean surfer turtles`

e.g., actor.name = author

we want to show how we can use both
- brain = BrainRepl({ repo: openai, slug: codex })
- brain = BrainAtom({ repo: xai, slug: 'grok/code-fast-1' })

as part if this, we also want to add a demo library for  BrainAtom({ repo: xai, slug: 'grok/code-fast-1' })

like we did here: src/_topublish/rhachet-brain-openai
