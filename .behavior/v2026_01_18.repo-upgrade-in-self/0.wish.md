wish =

when `npx rhachet upgrade` is invoked WITHIN a `rhachet-roles-*` repo

we must ensure not to overwrite the `file:.` specification of the version of the package within package.json

---

e.g.,

within `rhachet-roles-bhrain`, it'll already specify in `devDependencies` that `rhachet-roles-brain: file:.`, so that node resolution finds the collocated dist for tests

when we run `npx rhachet upgrade`, we want to retain that behavior. we dont want to overwrite it with a specific version

maybe more generally, if something says `file:.` as the version, dont touch that dependency
