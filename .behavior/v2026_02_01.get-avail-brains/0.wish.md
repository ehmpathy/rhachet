that we had 

  // for --help                                                                                                   
  const brains = getAvailableBrains(); // auto-discovers installed brain packages                                 
                                                                                    

so that composers of skills that leverage brains can allow autodiscovery of any brains

and also, update genContextBrain to support { brains: { repls, atoms } | 'discover' }

and let genContextBrain support brain discovery via getAvailableBrains by default

---

also, if we already have a fn called discoverAvail brains, just update the name

and make ContextCli an optional arg[2] context to genContextBrain, if we need that context for getAvailableBrains
