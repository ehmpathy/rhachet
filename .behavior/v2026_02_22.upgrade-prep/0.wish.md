wish that we had a --prep flag on `npx rhachet init` 

so that we can say 

`npx rhachet init --hooks --prep --roles x,y,z`

and on detection of --prep

rhachet would go ahead and upsert into package.json a script for 

`"prepare:rhachet": "npx rhachet init --hooks --roles x,y,z"`

and findsert 

"prepare": "..."

so that if it already exists, we findsert within "prepare" an `npm run prepare:rhachet` section (i.e., if already in there, great; if not, append to the end of the current prepare chain `&& npm run prepare:rhachet`)

(i.e., to ensure that next time the user installs, the latest roles w/ hooks would be initted) (and only include --hooks if the input included hooks at --prep time)
