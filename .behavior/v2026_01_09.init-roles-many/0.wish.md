we could just call

```sh
npx rhachet init --roles mechanic behaver reviewer
```

and it would initialize those roles from the repos that are currently installed via npm

---

i.e.,

rather than needing to run

`npx rhachet roles link --role mechanic && npx rhachet roles init --role mechanic`

for each role


the

```sh
npx rhachet init --roles mechanic behaver reviewer
```

command would tell rhachet to

1. find all the rhachet-roles-${repo} packages currently listed in package-json
2. for each of those packages, find their `packageRoot/rhachet.repo.yml`, which declares all of the info needed to `link` and `init`
   1. where the dirs are for each role
   2. what the inits are for each role
3. go ahead and execute link && init on each of those roles as found


---

note, this means that

1. we want to deprecate the `rhachet.use.ts` requirement. it should not be required for `npx rhachet roles link` nor `npx rhachet roles init` anymore
2. we want to add a new requirement to generate a `rhachet.repo.yml` within every rhachet-roles-${repo} publisher
   1. and to make it easy, we should add a new `npx rhachet repo introspect` command, which
      1. dynamically loads that packages registry and hooks, via `import { getRoleRegistry, getInvokeHooks } from '$package'`
      2. then, transforms that info into the `rhachet.repo.yml` which it then publishes at the root of the repo

and

3. we want to extend `npx rhachet init` to take in `--roles` which is a list of the different roles that we want to ini


---

note, we also want to support that, for cases when multiple repos have a role with the same name, we can distinguish via `$repo/$role` pattern

e.g.,

- ehmpathy/mechanic
- bhuild/behaver
- bhrain/reviewer
