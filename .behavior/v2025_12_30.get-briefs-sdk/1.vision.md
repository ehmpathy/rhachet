e.g., within

rhachet-roles-bhuild

be able to write a procedure called

```ts
const imagineBehaviorMeasuredGain = async (input, context) => {
  // get the briefs for measurement from this role
  const briefs = await getRoleBriefs({ by: { repo: { name: 'bhuild' }, role: { name: 'behaver' }, briefs: { glob: 'measure/*' }}})

  // and ask the brain.repl to measure based on those briefs
  const imagined = context.brain.repl.imagine({ prompt, role: { briefs } }, context)

  // ...
}
```

and that getRoleBriefs call would find all of the briefs from

`.agent/repo=bhuild/role=behaver/briefs` that match that glob

and return the `Artifact<typeof GitFile>[]` as the briefs
