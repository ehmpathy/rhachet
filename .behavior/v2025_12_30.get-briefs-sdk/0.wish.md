rhachet exposed a sdk procedure to conviniently getRoleBriefs({ by: { role: { name }, briefs: { name }[] }})

the goal is that

given
- a role is linked into the .agent/ dir

then
- rhachet would find the role by name (optional repo filter, in case there's multiple roles with that name) across all the role registries
- then it would find the brief by name (from the ones registered for that role)

---

why?

to make it easy to write new roles && compose roles

---

in the comments of that `getRoleBriefs` procedure, it should clarify that it looks into `.agent/*`, so if you just wrote a brief in the repo the role is defined in, you must `npm run build && npx rhachet role link` before it can be used again - to help remind callers of the procedure

it should return `Artifact<typeof GitFile>` as an output to make it easy for consumers to use it - but not require the brief to already be loaded into memory
