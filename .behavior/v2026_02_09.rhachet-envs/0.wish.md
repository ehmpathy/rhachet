wish =

that we supported env scoped keys via keyrack

specifically, as demonstrated here : .behavior/v2026_02_09.rhachet-envs/.refs/proposal.keys-per-env.md

except
- no need for backwards compat. folks can hardcut from `keys` to `env.all`
- we prefer them to know that they can scope per env

---

why do we need this?

cause AWS_PROFILE is the exact name of the envvar required in each environment

we cant scope it to AWS_PROFILE_PROD and etc

its reuqired to be AWS_PROFILE

and must be overridden if different env is unlocked

---

also, it should now be explicitly prescribable which org and env they want to set keys into

e.g.,

rhx keyrack set ... --org @this --env all

is the default ^

alias to

rhx keyrack set ... (without --org or --env)

---

or

rhx keyrack set ... --org @this --env prod (findserts the prod env.prod record into keyrack)

---

note, that they dont need to specify --org if the keyrack.yml already prescribes one (we can just reuse it)

and not that if they prescribe an org that's not --org @this or exactly $this org's name, we should fail fast
