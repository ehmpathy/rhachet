wish =

when `npx rhachet roles link --role x` is run

we want to upsert a `.gitattributes` file

which says

merge=theirs

on all the contents within that role's repo's dir

that way, if there's ever a merge conflict due to two branches having linked different versions of the same package

that merge conflict is autoresolved and doesn't frustrate the user

---

since the worst case scenario is that the symlinks may be broken, it'll be easy to detect, and the user will just be able to re-init their roles

so, we dont need to worry about that

its the same pattern most teams take with their `pnpm-lock.json` files

the errors failfast and failsafe, and the solution is a simple pnpm install


-----

actually, lets just gitignore them

i.e., eliminate the git diff from trackers all together. the role version is already tracked via package.json. and
  already just symlinks into node modules ; which means it wont work until someone runs npm install anyway. (and the recommendation is to add a prepare script to package.json which runs `npx rhachet init --roles x y z` which would trigger after npm install anyway)


  (; only for the repos that we explicitly linked from a
  published package; we dont want to touch collocated agent repos)
