upon `npx rhachet repo introspect`

we should check that the skills being published by the repo are all executable

they should not have any .sh files in that dir that are not executable, since otherwise, its most likely just a broken skill (e.g., thtey forgot to mark it as executable)

we can revist this decision in the future if theres valid usecases for this

but we expect there isn't

so lets failfast to help the role supplier publish usable packages and not break downstream role consumers' expectations
