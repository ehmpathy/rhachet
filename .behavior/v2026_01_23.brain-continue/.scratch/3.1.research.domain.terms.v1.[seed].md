BrainSession
vs
BrainThread


Session makes threads disambiguous


but maybe

StitchThread and BrainThread are worth having symetry?

i.e., threads within threads?


Session feels intangible. semantic diffusion

----

should websearch and see how the termr is used. is it diffused or preciece?

should also pros and cons

and consider alternate terms

and consider the fundamental core of the sematic concept we want to represent here
