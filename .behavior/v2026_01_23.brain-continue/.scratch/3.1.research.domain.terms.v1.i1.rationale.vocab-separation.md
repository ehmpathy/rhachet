# rationale: why not BrainThread/BrainStitch?

why we chose `BrainSession`/`BrainTurn` instead of `BrainThread`/`BrainStitch`

---

## 1. the question

if the navigator uses Thread and Stitch, why doesn't the brain use BrainThread and BrainStitch?

---

## 2. the answer

**different perspectives deserve different vocabulary.**

Thread/Stitch are navigator concepts — they imply orchestration, weave, composition. the brain doesn't orchestrate. the brain just converses.

Session/Turn are brain concepts — they match what suppliers actually call their constructs, and they reflect what the brain experiences: a conversation with exchanges.

## 3. what each perspective sees

### navigator (rhachet)

the navigator sees:
- a weave of thought routes
- threads that compose stitches
- orchestration across multiple brains
- deterministic and probabilistic steps interleaved

the navigator's vocabulary reflects **structure and composition**:
- Weave = all thought routes
- Thread = one thought route
- Stitch = one step in the route

### brain (supplier)

the brain sees:
- a conversation with a user
- messages back and forth
- no awareness of the broader orchestration
- no knowledge of other brains or deterministic steps

the brain's vocabulary reflects **dialogue and exchange**:
- Session = one continuous conversation
- Turn = one request-response pair

---

## 4. why this matters

### shared vocabulary would blur boundaries

if we used `BrainThread`, it would imply:
- the brain knows about threads (it doesn't)
- the brain participates in orchestration (it doesn't)
- threads are a brain-side concept (they're not)

### separate vocabulary reinforces separation

| who | what they own | their terms |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| navigator | orchestration structure | Weave, Thread, Stitch |
| brain | conversation state | Session, Turn |

the vocabulary difference signals:
- these are orthogonal views
- each perspective owns its own domain
- neither perspective bleeds into the other

---

## 5. industry alignment

the chosen terms also align with industry usage:

| term | precedent |
|------|-----------|
| Session | SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), Anthropic Claude SDK, web sessions |
| Turn | linguistics (turn exchange), conversation analysis, dialogue systems |

Thread/Stitch have no precedent in brain supplier APIs — they're rhachet-native concepts.

---

## 6. the principle

> **vocabulary reflects perspective. different perspectives, different vocabulary.**

the navigator orchestrates — it speaks in Weaves, Threads, and Stitches.

the brain converses — it speaks in Sessions and Turns.

to mix the vocabulary would conflate the perspectives and obscure the architecture.
