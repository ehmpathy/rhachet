# proposal: WeaveThread and WeaveStitch

rename `Thread` → `WeaveThread` and `Stitch` → `WeaveStitch` to capture orchestration scope

---

## tldr

| dimension | Thread/Stitch | WeaveThread/WeaveStitch |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| brevity | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ |
| disambiguation | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| ownership clarity | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ |
| symmetry with brain | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★★ |

**we prefer disambiguation and ownership clarity over brevity.**

"Thread" is overloaded (OS, email, social). "WeaveThread" is unambiguous and signals navigator ownership. WeaveThread/WeaveStitch wins.

## 1. the proposal

| current | proposed |
|---------|----------|
| `Thread` | `WeaveThread` |
| `Stitch` | `WeaveStitch` |

---

## 2. rationale

### explicit ownership

just as `BrainEpisode` makes it clear the episode belongs to the brain's perspective, `WeaveThread` makes it clear the thread belongs to the navigator's orchestration perspective.

| perspective | prefix | terms |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| navigator (orchestrator) | `Weave*` | WeaveThread, WeaveStitch |
| brain (supplier) | `Brain*` | BrainEpisode, BrainExchange |

### disambiguation

"Thread" is overloaded:
- OS threads (concurrency)
- email threads
- social media threads
- sew threads

"WeaveThread" is unambiguous — it's a thread in a weave.

### conceptual clarity

the prefix reminds readers:
- threads exist within weaves
- stitches exist within threads
- this is the navigator's orchestration structure

```
Weave
└── WeaveThread[] (thought routes)
    └── WeaveStitch[] (steps in the route)
```

---

## 3. symmetry with brain terms

the rename creates clean symmetry:

| layer | navigator | brain |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| container | Weave | — |
| unit | WeaveThread | BrainEpisode |
| step | WeaveStitch | BrainExchange |

both perspectives now have:
- explicit prefix that signals ownership
- clear hierarchy
- no ambiguity with external concepts

---

## 4. usage in code

### domain objects

```ts
class WeaveThread extends DomainEntity<WeaveThread> {
  public static unique = ['exid'] as const;
}

class WeaveStitch extends DomainEntity<WeaveStitch> {
  public static unique = ['threadRef', 'index'] as const;
}
```

### casual reference

```ts
// formal
const thread: WeaveThread = ...
const stitch: WeaveStitch = ...

// shorthand in local scope (acceptable)
const { thread, stitch } = weave.current;
```

## 5. comparative evaluation

### without prefix (current)

| dimension | score | rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| brevity | ★★★★★ | short, clean |
| disambiguation | ★★☆☆☆ | "Thread" collides with OS/email/social concepts |
| ownership clarity | ★★☆☆☆ | not obvious these are navigator concepts |
| symmetry with brain | ★★☆☆☆ | brain has prefix, navigator doesn't |

### with prefix (proposed)

| dimension | score | rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| brevity | ★★★☆☆ | longer, but not unwieldy |
| disambiguation | ★★★★★ | "WeaveThread" is unique |
| ownership clarity | ★★★★★ | prefix signals navigator ownership |
| symmetry with brain | ★★★★★ | both perspectives use prefix pattern |

---

## 6. the full vocabulary (updated)

| perspective | container | unit | step |
|-------------|-----------|------|------|
| navigator | Weave | WeaveThread | WeaveStitch |
| brain | — | BrainEpisode | BrainExchange |

---

## 7. open questions

### should Weave itself be renamed?

options:
- `Weave` (current) — the container of all threads
- `Orchestration` — more explicit but generic
- `ThoughtWeave` — parallel to WeaveThread

recommendation: keep `Weave` — it's already unique and serves as the namespace root.

### import ergonomics

```ts
// option a: full names
import { Weave, WeaveThread, WeaveStitch } from 'rhachet';

// option b: namespace import
import { Weave } from 'rhachet';
// then: Weave.Thread, Weave.Stitch

// option c: aliased import
import { WeaveThread as Thread, WeaveStitch as Stitch } from 'rhachet';
```

recommendation: option a (full names) for clarity; option c acceptable for local brevity.

---

## 8. recommendation

adopt `WeaveThread` and `WeaveStitch` to:
- create symmetry with `BrainEpisode` and `BrainExchange`
- disambiguate from overloaded "Thread" concept
- make orchestration ownership explicit in the type name
