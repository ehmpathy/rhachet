# blocker.1

 update the continuation acceptance tests to actually  create true blackbox
  acceptance tests w/ a new fixture which implements a demo brain provider (just mock
  the atom & repl to always parrot back the input words backwards)

  and leverage the ./dist dir to implement it (like the other tests do)




  i.e., we want to prove that suppliers of brains can leverage genBrainContinuables
  and easily supply brains too and test that full end to end lifecycle against the
  fixture'd brains
