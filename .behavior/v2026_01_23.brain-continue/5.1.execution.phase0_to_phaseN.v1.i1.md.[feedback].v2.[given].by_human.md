# blocker.0

split the brain continuation accpetance test into two, one for repl and one for atom

also, eliminate all the failhides from within it


# blocker.1

why is genBrainExchange outside of genBrainContinuables? literally required that it
  was part of it for simplicity; they hsould just pass in with: exchange: { input,
  output, exid }


        const exchange = genBrainExchange({
          with: {
            input: askInput.prompt,
            output: JSON.stringify(outputParsed),
            exid: null,
          },
        });
        const { episode } = genBrainContinuables({
          for: { grain: 'atom' },
          on: { episode: askInput.on?.episode ?? null },
          with: { exchange },
        });

# blocker.2

compute * hash should all be async, and should use the async hash version, for cross-platform portability

# blocker.3

export const genBrainContinuables = (input: {
  for: { grain: BrainGrain };
  on: {
    episode?: BrainEpisode | null;
    series?: BrainSeries | null;
  };
  with: {
    exchange: BrainExchange;
    exid?: { episode?: string | null; series?: string | null };
  };
}):

=>

with: { exchange: Pick<BrainExchange, 'exid' | 'input'|'output'>, episode: Pick<BrainEpisode, 'exid'>, series: Pick<BrainSeries, 'exid> }
