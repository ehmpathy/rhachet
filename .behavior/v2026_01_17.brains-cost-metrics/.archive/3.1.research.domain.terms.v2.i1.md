# domain terms research v2.i1

## .objective

distill terms for new domain objects to:
- maximize specificity => eliminate ambiguity & minimize confusion
- maximize intuition => eliminate friction & maximize adoption

to create a ubiquitous language for brain cost metrics.

---

## .summary of domain objects required

based on the wish and vision:

| object | purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **static brain profile** | what a brain costs and what you gain from it (fee schedule, capacity, capabilities) |
| **invocation result** | output plus metrics from a single brain call |
| **invocation metrics** | size and cost measurements from an invocation |

---

## .parallel concepts from other domains

### 1. healthcare: fee schedule

> "a fee schedule is a complete listing of fees used by Medicare to pay doctors or other providers/suppliers. This comprehensive listing of fee maximums is used to reimburse a physician and/or other providers on a fee-for-service basis." [1]

the healthcare industry uses **fee schedule** to describe the static price structure that providers publish. it lists maximum amounts for each service code.

**parallel**: a brain's cost structure (cost per input token, cost per output token) is analogous to a fee schedule.

### 2. advertisement: rate card

> "a rate card, also known as a rate sheet, is a structured table or list that sets out the different list prices that apply to a range of services provided to enable the buyer to compare the options available." [2]

> "in advertisement media, a rate card is a printed list of the charges associated with different amounts of time or space, different placements in the vehicle, and other conditions of sales." [2]

**parallel**: a brain's cost schedule is exactly like a rate card — it publishes what you'll pay per unit (token) for different categories (input, output, cache).

### 3. utilities: rate schedule & tariff

> "a rate schedule is a price plan or structure utilities use to bill customers." [3]

> "a tariff is the official terms and conditions statement that utilities publish with information on how a customer is billed." [3]

electricity bills use **rate schedule** for the price structure and **tariff** for the official terms. utilities meter **consumption** (kWh) and charge based on the rate schedule.

**parallel**: brain APIs meter token consumption and charge per the published rate.

### 4. culinary: recipe yield & cost per serve

> "yield in culinary terms refers to how much you will have of a finished or processed product." [4]

> "recipe cost is the process of to calculate the total cost of all ingredients used in a recipe." [4]

> "portion cost is the cost of an individual serve of a dish based on total recipe costs." [4]

the culinary industry explicitly separates:
- **yield** = what you get out
- **cost** = what you pay
- **portion cost** = cost per serve

**parallel**: brain invocations have yield (output tokens) and cost (cash per token). the "portion cost" is the total cash cost of one invocation.

### 5. manufacture: bill of materials (BOM)

> "a bill of materials (BOM) is a structured, comprehensive list of the materials, components, and parts required to manufacture or repair a product, as well as the quantities in which the materials are needed and their names, descriptions, and costs." [5]

> "a BOM is sometimes referred to as a product structure, an assembly component list or a production recipe in process industries." [5]

**parallel**: the brain's capabilities, context window, and benchmark scores are like a BOM — they list what goes into the "product" (the inference capability).

### 6. labor economics: wage rate & compensation

> "a wage is the price of labor." [6]

> "'compensation' is the sum of wages and salaries and benefits." [6]

labor economics distinguishes:
- **wage rate** = price per unit of labor
- **compensation** = total package with benefits

**parallel**: a brain's cash cost per token is like a wage rate. the full profile (cost + capabilities) is like total compensation.

### 7. finance: ROI & yield

> "return on investment (ROI) is the ratio between net income or profit to investment." [7]

> "a high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost." [7]

**parallel**: when to choose between brains, users implicitly calculate ROI — the quality gains vs cost. the brain's benchmark scores represent the "return" you get.

### 8. systems: capacity vs capability

> "capacity refers to the potential to perform at a certain standard... it comes with external constraints - resource availability, time and quantity or volume." [8]

> "capability refers to what a person can do in his or her daily environment... the ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and conditions." [8]

**parallel**:
- brain **capacity** = context window (how much it can hold)
- brain **capability** = what it can do (tooluse, vision, benchmark scores)

### 9. nutrition: facts label

> "serve sizes must be based on the amount of food people typically consume." [9]

> "all the nutrient amounts shown on the label, with the number of calories, refer to the size of the serve." [9]

the nutrition facts label is a standardized disclosure of:
- serve size (the unit)
- calories per serve (energy cost)
- nutrients (what you gain)

**parallel**: a brain profile is a "nutrition facts" for AI — it discloses cost per token and capabilities per invocation.

---

## .term analysis: the static brain profile

this is the primary domain object — what to call the static cost & gain profile of a brain.

### candidates

| term | pros | cons |
|------|------|------|
| **BrainUsage** | matches "usage-based price", common in cloud [10] | "usage" often means consumption (what was used), not the rate structure |
| **BrainRates** | parallel to "rate card", "rate schedule" | narrow — only covers cost, not capabilities |
| **BrainProfile** | parallel to "product profile" in manufacture [11] | generic, could mean many things |
| **BrainSpec** | parallel to "product specification" | focuses on technical details, less on economics |
| **BrainTariff** | parallel to utilities, economics [3] | archaic, negative connotations (trade tariffs) |
| **BrainFees** | direct, clear | narrow — only covers cost |
| **BrainCard** | parallel to "rate card" | too informal |
| **BrainMenu** | parallel to restaurant menu (items + prices) | too informal, implies selection not introspection |
| **BrainSheet** | parallel to "rate sheet", "spec sheet" | too generic |
| **BrainManifest** | parallel to ship manifest | implies inventory, not characteristics |

### deep analysis of "usage"

the term "usage" is ambiguous in this domain:

1. **usage as consumption** (past tense) — "your usage this month was 1M tokens"
2. **usage as rate structure** (policy) — "usage-based price at $3/mil"
3. **usage as capability** — "usage: intended for code generation"

> "usage meter is the process of to accurately measure and record the consumption of a product or service over time." [12]

the industry uses "usage" primarily for **consumption** (what was consumed), not the rate structure (what it costs).

### deep analysis of alternatives

**rate card** [2]: the advertisement industry's term for published prices. pros: directly maps to cost structure. cons: doesn't include capabilities (context window, benchmarks).

**fee schedule** [1]: healthcare's term for price tables. pros: formal, includes maximum fees. cons: doesn't include capabilities.

**tariff** [3]: utilities/economics term for published terms. pros: comprehensive. cons: modern connotations are negative (trade wars).

**profile** [11]: manufacture term for product characteristics. pros: includes both cost and capabilities. cons: generic.

**spec** [11]: tech term for technical characteristics. pros: precise. cons: focuses on technical, less on economics.

### proposal: domain-specific compound terms

given the unique nature of this domain (cost + gain), consider compound terms:

| term | sense |
|------|---------|
| **BrainEconomics** | the economics (cost + benefit) of use of a brain |
| **BrainTerms** | the terms (conditions, rates) for use of a brain |
| **BrainCostGain** | explicit: what it costs and what you gain |
| **BrainTradeoff** | the tradeoff profile (cost vs capability) |

### recommendation for static profile

**primary recommendation: `BrainRates`**

rationale:
- parallel to "rate card", "rate schedule" from advertisement/utilities [2][3]
- clear that it describes the price structure, not consumption
- commonly understood in cloud/API contexts

**alternative recommendation: `BrainTerms`**

rationale:
- parallel to "terms and conditions", "tariff terms" [3]
- comprehensive — can include both cost rates AND capability terms
- neutral and formal

**not recommended: `BrainUsage`**

rationale:
- "usage" primarily means consumption, not the rate structure [12]
- creates ambiguity: "get the brain's usage" could mean past consumption or rate structure

---

## .term analysis: cost vs gain structure

the vision proposes a structure with `cost` and `gain`. is this the right terminology?

### industry standard: cost-benefit analysis

> "cost-benefit analysis is a systematic approach used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives... compare the expected costs of an action or policy against the anticipated benefits." [13]

the standard term is **cost-benefit**, not "cost-gain". "benefit" is the established term in economics.

### difference between "benefit" and "gain"

> "both 'benefit' and 'gain' are correct words in English, but they are used in different contexts. 'Benefit' is often used to refer to an advantage or profit gained from some act, while 'gain' is more commonly used to indicate an increase or improvement in value, such as wealth or knowledge." [14]

- **benefit** = advantage received (often qualitative)
- **gain** = increase obtained (often quantitative)

### recommendation

**use `cost` and `gain`** for this domain, despite "benefit" as the economics standard.

rationale:
- brain capabilities are measurable and quantitative (context window, benchmark scores)
- "gain" emphasizes what you **get** in exchange for the cost
- "benefit" is softer, more qualitative
- in code, `brain.cost` and `brain.gain` read well together (same length, parallel structure)

## .term analysis: invocation result

what to call the result of a brain invocation (output + metrics)?

### candidates

| term | pros | cons |
|------|------|------|
| **BrainOutput** | clear — it's the output from the brain | could be confused with just the generated text |
| **BrainResult** | generic term for function returns | doesn't emphasize the metrics |
| **BrainResponse** | parallel to API response | doesn't emphasize the metrics |
| **BrainYield** | parallel to culinary yield [4] | could be confused with async generator yield |
| **BrainReturn** | parallel to function return, ROI return [7] | overloaded with language keywords |
| **BrainReceipt** | parallel to purchase receipt | implies transaction complete, less about content |

### recommendation: `BrainOutput`

the vision uses `BrainOutput<TOutput>` which is clear:
- `output` = the generated content (type `TOutput`)
- `metrics` = the measurements (type `BrainOutputMetrics`)

this structure mirrors the culinary pattern [4]:
- yield = what you get out (the food)
- cost per serve = what it cost to produce

---

## .term analysis: invocation metrics

what to call the measurements from an invocation?

### sub-structure analysis

the vision proposes:
```
metrics: {
  size: { input, output, cache }
  cost: { time, cash }
}
```

#### "size" vs alternatives

| term | sense in context |
|------|-------------------|
| **size** | quantity measured (tokens, chars) |
| **volume** | quantity consumed — parallel to cloud [10] |
| **consumption** | what was used up [12] |
| **quantity** | amount |

**recommendation: `size`** — it's neutral and covers both input and output dimensions.

#### "cost" sub-terms

the vision proposes `cost.time` and `cost.cash`.

**time**: clear — duration of the invocation
**cash**: explicit about monetary cost (vs "price" which implies rate, not total)

alternatives to "cash":
- `money` — too informal
- `price` — implies rate structure, not total cost
- `spend` — verb, not noun
- `charge` — could work, parallel to utilities [3]
- `bill` — implies invoice

**recommendation: keep `cash`** — explicit that this is the monetary total, not a rate.

---

## .term analysis: rate structure sub-terms

### input vs output tokens

the industry standard is clear [15]:

> "most LLMs divide bills into input (what you send) and output (what the model generates), measured in tokens." [15]

> "output tokens cost significantly more than inputs due to the intensive computation required for text generation." [15]

**recommendation: use `input` and `output`** — this is the industry standard.

### cache cost

prompt cache has two operations [15]:
- write to cache (usually 1x-2x normal input cost)
- read from cache (usually 10% of normal input cost)

the vision uses `cache: { get, set }`.

alternative: `cache: { read, write }` (parallel to filesystem)

**recommendation: `cache: { get, set }`** is fine — parallel to key-value stores.

---

## .full term recommendations

### static profile object

```ts
interface BrainSpec {
  cost: {
    time: {
      speed: { tokens: number; per: IsoDuration };  // output generation rate
      latency: IsoDuration;                          // time to first token
    };
    cash: {
      per: 'token';
      input: Price;           // cost per input token
      output: Price;          // cost per output token
      cache: {
        get: Price;           // cost to read from cache
        set: Price;           // cost to write to cache
      };
    };
  };
  gain: {
    capacity: {
      context: { tokens: number };  // context window
    };
    capability: {
      tooluse?: boolean;      // can use tools
      vision?: boolean;       // can process images
    };
    quality: {
      swe?: number;           // swe-bench score
      mmlu?: number;          // mmlu score
      humaneval?: number;     // humanrhachet completion --setupscore
    };
    knowledge: {
      cutoff: IsoDateStamp;   // cutoff of trained data
      domain: 'ALL' | 'SOFTWARE';
    };
  };
}
```

**note on gain sub-structure**:
- `capacity` = size limits (context window) [8]
- `capability` = what it can do (skills) [8]
- `quality` = how well it performs (benchmark scores)
- `knowledge` = what it knows (cutoff, domain)

### invocation result object

```ts
interface BrainOutput<TOutput> {
  output: TOutput;
  metrics: BrainOutputMetrics;
}

interface BrainOutputMetrics {
  size: {
    input: { chars: number; tokens: number };
    output: { chars: number; tokens: number };
    cache: {
      get: { tokens: number };
      set: { tokens: number };
    };
  };
  cost: {
    time: IsoDuration;
    cash: {
      input: Price;
      output: Price;
      cache: {
        get: Price;
        set: Price;
      };
      total: Price;
    };
  };
}
```

## .alternative term options

### option A: rate-centric terms ❌ REJECTED

| object | term |
|--------|------|
| static profile | `BrainRates` |
| invocation result | `BrainOutput` |
| invocation metrics | `BrainOutputMetrics` |

pros: emphasizes the cost/rate nature
cons: "rates" only connotes cost — `gain` (capabilities, quality) doesn't belong under "rates"

### option B: terms-centric terms

| object | term |
|--------|------|
| static profile | `BrainTerms` |
| invocation result | `BrainOutput` |
| invocation metrics | `BrainOutputMetrics` |

pros: parallel to "terms and conditions", comprehensive
cons: sounds legalistic

### option C: economics-centric terms

| object | term |
|--------|------|
| static profile | `BrainEconomics` |
| invocation result | `BrainYield` |
| invocation metrics | `BrainYieldMetrics` |

pros: emphasizes the cost-benefit analysis nature
cons: "yield" conflicts with JavaScript generators

### option D: profile-centric terms

| object | term |
|--------|------|
| static profile | `BrainProfile` |
| invocation result | `BrainOutput` |
| invocation metrics | `BrainOutputMetrics` |

pros: parallel to "product profile" [11], comprehensive
cons: generic, could mean many different shapes

### option E: spec-centric terms ✅ RECOMMENDED

| object | term |
|--------|------|
| static profile | `BrainSpec` |
| invocation result | `BrainOutput` |
| invocation metrics | `BrainOutputMetrics` |

pros: parallel to "product specification" [11], legitimately contains both cost AND capabilities
cons: none significant — "spec" is comprehensive by nature

---

## .final recommendation

**recommended: spec-centric terms**

| object | recommended term |
|--------|-----------------|
| static profile | `BrainSpec` |
| invocation result | `BrainOutput<T>` |
| invocation metrics | `BrainOutputMetrics` |

**rationale**:
1. `BrainSpec` legitimately contains both `cost` AND `gain` — a specification includes economic and technical details
2. parallel to "product specification" which covers features, performance, AND cost [11]
3. `BrainRates` was rejected because "rates" only connotes cost, not capabilities — `gain` doesn't belong under "rates"
4. `BrainOutput` is already well-named in the vision
5. short, technical, unambiguous

**sdk operations** (from vision, adjusted):
```ts
// lookup the spec of any brain
const spec = await getBrainSpec({ by: { brain } }, context);

// calculate expected cost before invocation
const estimate = calcBrainOutputCost({ of: { brain }, for: { tokens } }, context);
```
