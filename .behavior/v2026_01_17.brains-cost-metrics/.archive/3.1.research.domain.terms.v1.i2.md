# research: domain terms for brain cost metrics

this document proposes terminology options for the new domain objects required to fulfill the brain cost metrics feature.

objective:
- maximize specificity → eliminate ambiguity & minimize confusion
- maximize intuition → eliminate friction & maximize adoption

to create a ubiquitous language.

## cross-domain parallels

> the older the domain, the deeper the words

software is young. older domains have refined their vocabulary over centuries. we can learn from them.

### etymological foundations

> [18] "toll was a legal term for the right to charge for certain imports, products, sales, passages, etc., and the specific meaning 'charge for right of passage along a road' dates from the late 15th century" — [etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/toll)

> [19] "the sense of 'produce, bear, bring forth,' also 'give in return for labor' emerged around c. 1300. the extended sense of 'production, something obtained as a result of work or action' (as of crops) is attested by mid-15c" — [etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/yield)

> [20] "tally goes back to the time when things were commonly counted by cutting notches in a stick of wood. the split tally was accepted as legal proof in medirhachet completion --setupcourts" — [etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tally)

> [21] "the english word vital comes from the latin vitalis, which means 'pertaining to life' or 'alive.' the sense of 'necessary or important' emerged from the 1610s, via the notion of 'essential to life'" — [etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/vitals)

> [22] "in cooking, yield is a term that refers to the amount of food or ingredients that you can expect to get after cooking or processing them. it's an essential concept to understand when planning meals" — [roybalfood](https://www.roybalfood.com/post/what-you-should-know-about-yield-in-cooking-and-food-processing)

> [23] "the split tally became a prevalent technique in medirhachet completion --setupeurope, a time characterised by a scarcity of coinage and widespread illiteracy, to document bilateral exchanges and debts" — [geoffreymhodgson](https://www.geoffreymhodgson.uk/secret-history-of-tally-stick)

> [24] "most roads were not freely open to travel on in europe during the middle ages, and the toll was one of many feudal fees paid for rights of usage in everyday life" — [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_toll_(historical))

### 1. static profile parallels

| domain | term | definition | age |
|--------|------|------------|-----|
| trades | **rate card** | what a tradesperson charges per unit of work | ~500y |
| trades | **spec sheet** | equipment characteristics and capabilities | ~200y |
| freight | **manifest** | complete record of cargo contents and value | ~400y |
| healthcare | **formulary** | catalog of drugs with costs and coverage tiers | ~150y |
| healthcare | **fee schedule** | what each procedure costs | ~100y |
| recreation | **scout report** | player assessment: strengths, weaknesses, value | ~100y |
| recreation | **handicap** | standardized capability measure (golf) | ~300y |
| culinary | **menu** | what's available at what price | ~200y |

**insight**: trades use **rate card** — it captures both "what you pay" and "what you get" in one term. a brain's cost/gain profile is essentially a rate card.

**insight**: healthcare uses **formulary** — a catalog where each item has cost tiers and coverage rules. brains have similar tiered costs (input vs output vs cache).

### 2. result wrapper parallels

| domain | term | definition | age |
|--------|------|------------|-----|
| trades | **job ticket** | work completed + materials used + time spent | ~150y |
| trades | **work order** | request fulfilled + completion record | ~100y |
| freight | **waybill** | proof of delivery + cargo details | ~600y |
| healthcare | **encounter** | single patient interaction + services rendered | ~100y |
| healthcare | **discharge summary** | stay record + outcomes + charges | ~80y |
| recreation | **scorecard** | performance record + final result | ~200y |
| recreation | **box score** | game summary: stats + outcome in one view | ~150y |
| culinary | **ticket** | order + modifications + time | ~100y |
| culinary | **check** | meal consumed + itemized charges | ~200y |

**insight**: healthcare uses **encounter** — a single interaction that bundles what happened with measurements taken. an llm call is an encounter.

**insight**: recreation uses **scorecard** — it captures both the output (score) and the metrics (strokes per hole). exactly what we need.

### 3. invocation metrics parallels

| domain | term | definition | age |
|--------|------|------------|-----|
| trades | **timesheet** | hours worked, broken by task | ~150y |
| trades | **tally** | count of discrete items | ~1000y |
| trades | **log** | sequential record of activity | ~400y |
| freight | **tonnage** | cargo weight measure | ~500y |
| healthcare | **vitals** | key measurements (pulse, temp, bp) | ~200y |
| healthcare | **labs** | test results with reference ranges | ~100y |
| recreation | **stats** | performance numbers | ~150y |
| recreation | **line** | odds/performance in compact form | ~200y |
| culinary | **yield** | quantity produced from inputs | ~500y |
| culinary | **portion** | standardized amount per serve | ~300y |

**insight**: culinary uses **yield** — what you get out given what you put in. token output from token input is a yield.

**insight**: healthcare uses **vitals** — the essential measurements that tell the story. token counts are the vitals of an llm call.

### 4. monetary amount parallels

| domain | term | definition | age |
|--------|------|------------|-----|
| trades | **wage** | pay for work done | ~800y |
| trades | **rate** | price per unit | ~600y |
| trades | **fare** | price for transport | ~700y |
| trades | **toll** | price for passage | ~1000y |
| healthcare | **copay** | patient's share of cost | ~50y |
| healthcare | **charge** | price for service rendered | ~200y |
| recreation | **stake** | amount wagered | ~400y |
| recreation | **ante** | entry cost to participate | ~300y |
| recreation | **purse** | prize pool / total payout | ~500y |
| culinary | **tab** | accumulated charges | ~200y |
| culinary | **check** | total due for consumption | ~300y |

**insight**: **toll** is ancient (~1000y) — a fee for passage through a gate. tokens pass through the model; we pay a toll per token.

**insight**: **fare** is transport-specific price. perhaps too narrow, but evocative — you pay fare for the journey the tokens take.

## cross-domain term candidates

from the parallels above, new options emerge:

### for static profile

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| `BrainRateCard` | trades | precise: "what you pay per unit of work" | verbose; two words |
| `BrainManifest` | freight | implies complete inventory of capabilities | typically for cargo contents |
| `BrainFormulary` | healthcare | implies tiered costs by category | unfamiliar outside healthcare |
| `BrainHandicap` | recreation | standardized capability measure | implies disability in common usage |

### for result wrapper

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| `BrainEncounter` | healthcare | single interaction + measurements | clinical connotation |
| `BrainTicket` | culinary/trades | complete record of one transaction | overloaded in software (jira) |
| `BrainScorecard` | recreation | output + metrics in one view | implies competition/game |
| `BrainTally` | trades | record of what was counted/done | too focused on tally alone |

### for invocation metrics

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| `BrainYield` | culinary | what you got from what you put in | could confuse with js yield |
| `BrainVitals` | healthcare | essential measurements | implies health/status |
| `BrainTally` | trades | count of discrete items | too simple |
| `BrainLog` | trades/freight | sequential activity record | implies append-only history |

### for monetary amount

| option | source domain | pros | cons |
|--------|---------------|------|------|
| `Toll` | trades | ancient; fee per passage | implies obstruction |
| `Fare` | trades | price for journey | too transport-specific |
| `Tab` | culinary | accumulated charges | implies cumulative total |
| `Charge` | healthcare | price for service | could be verb or noun |

---

## new domain objects required

from the wish and vision, we need terms for:

1. **static profile** — the cost & gain characteristics of a brain (rates, context window, benchmarks)
2. **result wrapper** — the object returned from `.ask()` and `.act()` that contains output + metrics
3. **invocation metrics** — size and cost measurements from a single invocation
4. **monetary amount** — a value object for cash costs

---

## terminology research

### 1. static profile (cost & gain of a brain)

#### industry terminology

> [1] "the model card is a means of documenting vital elements of an ml model so users can readily understand the intended use cases, characteristics, behaviors, ethical considerations, and the biases and limitations of a particular ml model" — [techtarget](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/model-card-in-machine-learning)

> [2] "the full model card specification allows specifying languages, licenses, tags, datasets, metrics, as well as the evaluation results the model obtained" — [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards)

> [3] "benchmark cards are intended to pick up where model cards leave off. they can give you a more contextualized perspective on the model's behavior" — [ibm](https://research.ibm.com/blog/documentation-for-LLM-benchmarks)

#### common terms in the wild

| term | used for | source |
|------|----------|--------|
| `model card` | documentation of model characteristics | huggingface, google |
| `model spec` | behavioral specification | openai |
| `price rates` | cost rates | all providers |
| `capabilities` | what the model can do | anthropic, openai |
| `context window` | token capacity | all providers |
| `knowledge cutoff` | data freshness date | all providers |

#### proposed options

| option | source | pros | cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| `BrainCard` | llm industry | aligns with "model card" industry term; short | "card" implies documentation, not runtime data |
| `BrainSpec` | llm industry | aligns with "model spec"; implies formal definition | "spec" can imply requirements vs actual capabilities |
| `BrainProfile` | software | intuitive; "profile" = summary of characteristics | less common in llm industry |
| `BrainRates` | software | precise for cost dimension | misses the "gain" dimension (benchmarks, context) |
| `BrainRateCard` | trades (~500y) | precise: "what you pay per unit of work"; captures cost + capability | verbose; two words |
| `BrainMenu` | culinary (~200y) | implies "what's available at what price" | too informal for enterprise |
| `BrainManifest` | freight (~400y) | complete inventory of capabilities | typically for cargo contents |
| `BrainFormulary` | healthcare (~150y) | implies tiered costs by category | unfamiliar outside healthcare |

**recommendation**: `BrainRates` or `BrainMenu`
- `BrainRates` for formal precision — "the rates of a brain"
- `BrainMenu` for intuitive accessibility — "what's on the menu" is universally understood
- cross-domain insight: **rate card** from trades (~500y) is the deepest parallel — both cost and capability in one term

---

### 2. result wrapper (output + metrics)

#### industry terminology

> [4] "a better approach is to return a result object that encapsulates the success or failure of the operation. this contains either a value or an error message" — [medium](https://medium.com/@aseem2372005/the-result-pattern-in-c-a-smarter-way-to-handle-errors-c6dee28a0ef0)

> [5] "the result object now becomes a reliable source of truth for the entire application" — [medium](https://medium.com/@elhelw258/unified-api-response-in-net-web-api-bc4bf62c638e)

> [6] "the hard-coded name of result could be whatever sounds sensible—like payload or response" — [shazow](https://shazow.net/posts/how-i-design-json-api-responses/)

#### common terms in the wild

| term | used for | source |
|------|----------|--------|
| `Result<T>` | wrapper with success/error | rust, .net |
| `Response` | api response wrapper | rest apis |
| `Output` | model output | ml/ai |
| `Completion` | chat completion response | openai |
| `Message` | response message | anthropic |

#### proposed options

| option | source | pros | cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| `BrainResult<T>` | software | aligns with Result pattern; generic | "result" implies success/failure, not metrics |
| `BrainResponse<T>` | software | familiar api pattern | implies http response |
| `BrainOutput<T>` | software | clear — what came out of the brain | could confuse with `TOutput` itself |
| `BrainReply<T>` | software | conversational; clear intent | less common in api patterns |
| `BrainYield<T>` | culinary (~500y) | "what you got from inputs"; ancient and precise | could confuse with js generators |
| `BrainEncounter<T>` | healthcare (~100y) | single interaction + measurements; complete record | clinical connotation |
| `BrainTicket<T>` | culinary/trades (~100y) | complete record of one transaction | overloaded in software (jira tickets) |
| `BrainScorecard<T>` | recreation (~200y) | output + metrics in one view | implies competition/game |

**recommendation**: `BrainYield<T>` or `BrainOutput<T>`
- `BrainYield<T>` for depth — "yield" (~500y) captures input→output transformation precisely
- `BrainOutput<T>` for familiarity — aligns with wish terminology and ml conventions
- cross-domain insight: **yield** from culinary is the deepest parallel — "what you got from what you put in"

---

### 3. invocation metrics (size and cost measurements)

#### industry terminology

> [7] "the common usage metrics in llm apis include: requests, input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens" — [openai agents sdk](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/usage/)

> [8] "observability dashboards typically display key metrics such as token usage, api call distribution, and model-wise invocation counts" — [zenml](https://www.zenml.io/blog/best-llm-monitoring-tools)

> [9] "it can be fun to include a stats object with performance information" — [shazow](https://shazow.net/posts/how-i-design-json-api-responses/)

#### common terms in the wild

| term | used for | source |
|------|----------|--------|
| `usage` | token consumption | openai, anthropic |
| `metrics` | measurements | observability tools |
| `stats` | statistics | api responses |
| `telemetry` | observability data | sdks |
| `cost` | monetary spend | bill systems |

#### proposed options

| option | source | pros | cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| `BrainMetrics` | software | generic; covers size + cost | very generic |
| `BrainUsage` | llm industry | aligns with openai/anthropic "usage" | overloaded — consumption vs rates |
| `BrainStats` | software | short; informal | less precise |
| `BrainTelemetry` | software | implies observability | overloaded term |
| `BrainVitals` | healthcare (~200y) | essential measurements; tells the story | implies health/status |
| `BrainTally` | trades (~1000y) | count of discrete items; ancient and simple | too focused on counts alone |
| `BrainLog` | trades/freight (~400y) | sequential activity record | implies append-only history |
| `BrainTonnage` | freight (~500y) | cargo weight measure; evocative | too freight-specific |

**recommendation**: `BrainVitals` or `BrainTally`
- `BrainVitals` for expressiveness — "the vitals of this call" instantly communicates key measurements
- `BrainTally` for simplicity — ancient term (~1000y) for discrete counts; tokens are tallied
- cross-domain insight: **vitals** from healthcare captures "essential measurements" perfectly

---

### 4. monetary amount (price value object)

#### industry terminology

> [10] "money behaves differently from a simple number, and thus should be treated differently. the first and most important aspect is that it should always be composed of an amount and a currency" — [frontstuff](https://frontstuff.io/how-to-handle-monetary-values-in-javascript)

> [11] "instances of money are immutable and each arithmetic operation will return a new instance of the object" — [ts-money](https://github.com/macor161/ts-money)

> [12] "token-based price is how most ai companies charge for their services. prices are typically listed per 1M tokens as the standard unit" — [afternoon.co](https://www.afternoon.co/blog/token-based-pricing-guide)

#### common terms in the wild

| term | used for | source |
|------|----------|--------|
| `Money` | monetary value | fowler, dinero.js |
| `Price` | cost of item | commerce |
| `Cost` | expense incurred | finance |
| `Rate` | price per unit | bills |
| `Amount` | quantity of currency | banks |

#### proposed options

| option | source | pros | cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| `Price` | commerce | intuitive; "what it costs" | could imply "list price" vs "actual cost" |
| `Money` | software (fowler) | aligns with fowler pattern | generic; not domain-specific |
| `Cost` | commerce | what was spent | could be verb or noun |
| `Amount` | commerce | neutral term | very generic |
| `Toll` | trades (~1000y) | fee per passage; ancient and precise | implies obstruction |
| `Fare` | trades (~700y) | price for journey | too transport-specific |
| `Tab` | culinary (~200y) | accumulated charges | implies cumulative total |
| `Charge` | healthcare (~200y) | price for service rendered | could be verb or noun |
| `Wage` | trades (~800y) | pay for work done | implies labor payment |

**recommendation**: `Toll` or `Price`
- `Toll` for depth — ancient term (~1000y) for fee per passage; tokens pass through the model gate
- `Price` for familiarity — universally understood; aligns with vision
- cross-domain insight: **toll** is the deepest parallel — a toll is paid for passage through a gate; tokens pass through the model and we pay per token

## proposed term sets

### set A: cross-domain depth (ancient terms)

| concept | term | source | age | rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-----|-----------|
| static profile | `BrainMenu` | culinary | ~200y | "what's available at what price" — universally understood |
| result wrapper | `BrainYield<T>` | culinary | ~500y | "what you got from inputs" — captures transformation |
| invocation metrics | `BrainTally` | trades | ~1000y | discrete counts — ancient and simple |
| monetary amount | `Toll` | trades | ~1000y | fee per passage — tokens pass through the gate |

### set B: industry alignment (software terms)

| concept | term | source | rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| static profile | `BrainRates` | software | "the rates of a brain" — formal and precise |
| result wrapper | `BrainOutput<T>` | ml/ai | "output from brain" — aligns with wish |
| invocation metrics | `BrainVitals` | healthcare | "essential measurements" — expressive |
| monetary amount | `Price` | commerce | universally understood; aligns with vision |

### set C: hybrid (best of both)

| concept | term | source | age | rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-----|-----------|
| static profile | `BrainMenu` | culinary | ~200y | intuitive; "what's on the menu" |
| result wrapper | `BrainYield<T>` | culinary | ~500y | deep; captures input→output |
| invocation metrics | `BrainVitals` | healthcare | ~200y | expressive; "the vitals of this call" |
| monetary amount | `Toll` | trades | ~1000y | ancient; fee per passage |

**recommendation**: **set C (hybrid)** — balances depth with intuition
- `BrainMenu` is universally understood ("what's on the menu?")
- `BrainYield<T>` captures the essence of transformation
- `BrainVitals` communicates "key measurements" instantly
- `Toll` is ancient and precise — tokens pay toll to pass through

## how folks commonly talk about these

### static profile

> [13] "gemini 3 pro, grok 4, and llama 4 maverick all feature 1 million token context windows" — [azumo](https://azumo.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-insights/top-10-llms-0625)

> [14] "claude 4 opus leads code benchmarks with 72.5% swe-bench" — [azumo](https://azumo.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-insights/top-10-llms-0625)

> [15] "the knowledge cutoff date is the point in time up to which a large language model received data" — [gradually.ai](https://www.gradually.ai/en/ai-glossary/knowledge-cutoff-date/)

developers talk about models in terms of:
- **context window** (capacity)
- **benchmark scores** (capability)
- **knowledge cutoff** (freshness)
- **price per token** (cost)

### invocation metrics

> [16] "values in the usage section of the response from the llm api are used to determine token usage" — [microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/llm-token-limit-policy)

> [17] "since llm apis can get expensive fast, tools that track token usage and let you set alerts on spend are recommended" — [zenml](https://www.zenml.io/blog/best-llm-monitoring-tools)

developers talk about invocations in terms of:
- **tokens used** (input, output, cached)
- **cost incurred** (dollars spent)
- **latency** (time elapsed)
