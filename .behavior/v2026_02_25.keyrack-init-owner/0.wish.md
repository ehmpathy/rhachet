we want to enable the `npx rhachet keyrack init --owner` --owner flag to enable init of custom host manifests

we already support custom --owner s of host manifests per machine

we had a usecase where a local integration test needed to extract keys from keyrack

but got blocked cause they tried to use the machine default and that was locked

---

we went to try and init the keyrack for the custom --owner, but were not able to do so

ideally, we can

`npx rhachet keyrack init --owner ehmpath.demo` and then `npx rhachet keyrack set --key SEATURTLE_EHMPATHY_GITHUB_PAT --vault os.secure --owner ehmpath.demo` and put a demo token in there

so that way, the skill that runs this integration test could run a flow where 
1. it `npx rhachet keyrack get --key EHMPATH_SEATURTLE_GITHUB_PAT` and tries to grab it from default host (e.g., for prod paths)
2. it `npx rhachet keyrack get --key EHMPATH_SEATURTLE_GITHUB_PAT --owner ehmpath.demo` as a fallback 

---

later, we can think about how to easily share those ehmpath.demo host manifests across maintainers

---

for now though, we just want to ensure that maintainers of skills packages _can_ set keys into custom owner host manifests

so that 
- their machine's demo keys can have narrow privs and live under the demo host manifest and use passwordless ssh keys (to make it easy for tests to use them)
- their machine's main keys can have broader privs, to fullfill the full usage intent of the skills, backed by secured ssh keys (to keep them secure and useful)

---

just want to ensure that we have extra test coverage that vaults like os.secure and os.direct and os.daemon _are_ indeed also namespaced per owner, so that demo keys cant overwrite real keys, for example
