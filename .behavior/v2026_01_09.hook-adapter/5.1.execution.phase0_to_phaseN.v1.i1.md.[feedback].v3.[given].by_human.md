# blocker.1

syncAllRoleHooksIntoEachBrainRepl should run on all roles. not just
  per registry. add a `HasRepo<T> = T & { repo: string }`; then, just
  have syncAllRoleHooksIntoEachBrainRepl take in an input of roles:
  HasRepo<Role>[] ; and the reads should all just return HasRepo<Role>
  to make all the shapes fit smoothly (especially since the reads know
  where they read the role from)

# blocker.2

prune...FromOneBrain

should be called by

prune...FromAllBrains


we should elminate all domain.operation knowledge from src/domain.operations/init/syncHooksForLinkedRoles.ts

and make it a thin dispatcher & stdouter
