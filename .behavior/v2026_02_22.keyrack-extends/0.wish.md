wish =

copy this handoff doc at /home/vlad/git/ehmpathy/rhachet-roles-ehmpathy/.handoff/keyrack.contract.md

into this .behavior/ under the .refs/ dir

---

read it, ingest it, and lets fulfill it

we want to support repo level 'extends' contract so that we can say 

keyrack.yml

extends:
  - .agent/repo=ehmpathy/roles=mechanic/keyrack.yml

---

we also want to make sure that the link operation will link it successfully, if declared (just like the boot.yml)

and cover that with acceptance tests

and we also want to add to the Role definition the ability to prescribe a .keyrack 

just like we added (or should have added, if not, add it now), the ability to describe a .boot

which is just the path to the .keyrack file and the .boot file which will get linked on `roles link`

---

last, we need to add that ability to `keyrack init --at $path/to/custom/keyrack.yml` for the adhoc init of role based keyrack ymls that will later be extended;

---

also, to be clear,

when we say `extends`

we expect it to be a path to a full legitimate other `keyrack.yml` repo manifest

and we expect to append all of the contents from that one into this one
