wish =

standardize `npx rhachet act --attempts`

with the original behavior of `npx rhachet ask --attempts`


---


specifically,

# first
we should MOVE the behavior within `npx rhachet ask --skill` into `npx rhachet act --skill`, with the same behavior as `npx rhachet run` has today, where if its registered as a rigid skill, then use the actor registered version of the skill - otherwise, use the original version (in this case, the stitch version)


# second

we want to leverage the same exact mechanism + logs + etc that the original `npx rhachet ask --attempts` used to power the attempts in both modes

the logs and parallelization to support that original --attempts was carefully tuned

we want to leverage that same exact utility

shift the contract as needed in order to be able to generally supprot both modes with the same codepath && same logs


# third

make sure that we failfast is the rigid skill that --act is invoked on via actor mode does not have --output as one of the required inputs.


---

last, of course, we want thorough accept.blackbox & integration test coverage on it
