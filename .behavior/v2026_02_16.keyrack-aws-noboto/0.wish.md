wish =

finish the job from the keyrack-aws behavior

that behavior was left in the stage where it erroneously uses the boto auth flow instead of the correct session auth flow

scan .behavior/v2026_02_09.keyrack-aws/*

understand it 

and track down how to properly invoke aws sso auth to setup auth and unlock auth keys via the aws sso grant

track down best practices for what a human experiences when they auth and approve

and ensure that they get the same experience in both rhx keyrack set && rhx keyrack unlock 

and ensure that our system properly detects if the key is still valid


we need to support this experience; .behavior/v2026_02_09.keyrack-aws/7.runbook.manual-test.md

https://github.com/ehmpathy/declastruct-aws/blob/main/provision/aws.auth/readme.md


this project declares a readme of a config which goes through the human, correct experience for sso auth via aws

it works without any relationship to boto

that's the same flow we need to support

with the same structure of config
