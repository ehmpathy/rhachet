wish =

the Role dobj had an inits attribute. 

similar to skills and briefs

---

its purpose is to contain commands that are only useful at instantiate

e.g., 
- init.claude.sh
- init.bhuild.sh
- etc

they're not skills that an agent should use as part of their role -> they should not be emitted as part of `npx rhachet roles boot`

but rather they're initializations that should be invoked to setup an agent

e.g., upon `npx rhachet roles init` of a given role

its attributes should be 

Role.inits = {
  // the dirs to link whenever `npx rhachet roles link -- role X` is run for this role (just like briefs and skills)
  dirs: { uri: string } | { uri: string }[],

  // the cmds to execute whenever `npx rhachet roles init --role X` is run for this role
  exec: { cmd: string }[],
}

as part of this wish, we want to support
1. declaration of this .inits attribute on a role
2. the symlink of these dirs when `npx rhachet roles link` is run (in addition to the current skills and briefs)
3. support for `npx rhachet roles init`, which invokes the Role.inits.exec cmds
