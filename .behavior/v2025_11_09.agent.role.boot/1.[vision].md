.agent/ should be a standard directory for the .briefs and .skills needed to work with brains of any kind, from both human and robot agents

---

in there, you'd find skills of common .sh commands that are helpful in the repo
- e.g., start the service and run a healthcheck againast it locally
- e.g., apply terraform against a given command, without having to remember which directory its in
we call these skills

as well as common .brief docs that are helpful to understand about concepts in the repo
- e.g., code styles
- e.g., domain knowledge
we call these briefs

---

these .agent/ .skills and .briefs are useful for both
- human agents (e.g., developers, solvers, operators, etc)
- robot agents (e.g., claude, copilot, etc)

---

rhachet can be used to boot up those dirs based on briefs from related repos
e.g., `npx rhachet roles link --repo ehmpathy --role mechanic`
- findserts `.agent/readme.md`
- findserts `.agent/repo=.this/readme.md`
- upserts `.agent/repo=ehmpathy/role=mechanic/readme.md`
- upserts `.agent/repo=ehmpathy/role=mechanic/briefs/*` (effectively what `npx rhachet briefs link` does today)
- upserts `.agent/repo=ehmpathy/role=mechanic/skills/*`

then, `npx rhachet roles boot --repo ehmpathy --role mechanic`
- would run what `npx rhachet briefs boot` does today
- but for both briefs and skills
  - for the skills, it would just show the docs of each skill, not the implementation


====


the miracle?

you can bootup reliable roles from any rhachet repo

the brain of any agent can use your skills

and your skills can use the robot:brain of any robot:agent too

portable; composable; evolvable
