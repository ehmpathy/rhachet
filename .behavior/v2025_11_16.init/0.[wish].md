wish it were easy to initialize the `rhachet.use.ts` config file after install

i.e.,

`npx rhachet init` should automatically create a `rhachet.use.ts` file and include all of the repos that it finds by `package.json` and package starts with `rhachet-roles`


e.g., if package json includes only package `rhachet-roles-ehmpathy`

then `rhachet.use.ts` should be created with

```ts
import { getRoleRegistry } from 'rhachet-roles-ehmpathy';

import { getInvokeHooks } from 'rhachet-roles-ehmpathy';

export const getRoleRegistries = () => [getRoleRegistry()];
export const getInvokeHooks = () => [getInvokeHooks()]
```

---

also, ensure that we support a list of invokehooks exported from the config and apply each of them
